		Preface to the Second Edition
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The rapid sale of a large edition of this volume evidences an amount of interest in the study of the Book of Leviticus, for which I unfeignedly bless the Lord.<a name=0:1></a> Too many, even of the people of God, seem to think that this section of inspiration contains nothing of any interest or value to them.<a name=0:2></a> They regard it as a detail of rites and ceremonies with which they have nothing to do -- a record of by-gone institutions, affording no instruction or edification for them.<a name=0:3></a> That this is a great mistake, thousands are now discovering.<a name=0:4></a> Very many who for years, looked upon the Book of Leviticus as little more than a dry catalogue of Jewish ordinances, are now discovering in it an exhaustless mine of spiritual wealth for which they cannot be too thankful.<a name=0:5></a> They have brought its marvellous pages under the light of the New Testament scriptures, and they can only wonder at that which is now unfolded to their gaze.<a name=0:6></a> That they may discover yet more of the precious treasure, is my earnest desire on their behalf.<a name=0:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have carefully revised the following pages, and, I may say, I have left them very much as I found them.<a name=0:8></a> An expression, here and there, which seemed likely to be misunderstood, I have slightly touched.<a name=0:9></a> I have also added a brief note or two.<a name=0:10></a> These trifling matters excepted, the Second Edition is a reprint of the First, and, as such, it is again committed to the care of Him from whom all blessings flow.<a name=0:11></a> May He be graciously pleased to crown it, still further, with the stamp of His approval.<a name=0:12></a> His seal and sanction are all that any book requires to make it useful; and, truly, we may say, the book that has not these, has nothing.<a name=0:13></a>

		LEVITICUS 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ere entering upon the details of the chapter before us, there are two things which demand our careful consideration; namely, first, Jehovah's position; and, secondly, the order in which the offerings are presented.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And the Lord called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=1:2></a>" Such was the position from which Jehovah made the communications contained in this Book, He had been speaking from Mount Sinai, and his position, there, gave marked character to the communication.<a name=1:3></a> From the fiery mount "went a fiery law;" but, here, He speaks "out of the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=1:4></a>" This was an entirely different position.<a name=1:5></a> We have seen this tabernacle set up, at the close of the preceding book.<a name=1:6></a> "And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate.<a name=1:7></a> So Moses finished the work.<a name=1:8></a> Then a cloud
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle .<a name=2:1></a>.<a name=2:2></a>.<a name=2:3></a> .<a name=2:4></a>.<a name=2:5></a>.<a name=2:6></a> .<a name=2:7></a> For the glory of the Lord was upon the tabernacle, by day, and fire was on it, by night, in the sight of all the House of Israel, throughout all their journeys" (Exodus 40: 33-38).<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the tabernacle was God's dwelling place, in grace.<a name=2:9></a> He could take up His, abode there, because He was surrounded, on all sides, by that which vividly set forth the ground of His relationship with the people.<a name=2:10></a> Had He come into their midst, in the full display of the character revealed upon Mount Sinai, it could only have been to "consume them in a moment," as a "Stiff-necked people.<a name=2:11></a>" But He retired within the veil -- type of Christ's flesh, (Hebrews 10: 20) -- and took His place on the mercy seat where the blood of atonement, and not the "stiff-neckedness" of Israel, was that which met His view, and satisfied the claims of His nature.<a name=2:12></a> The blood which was brought into the sanctuary, by the high priest, was the type of that precious blood which cleanses from all sin; and, although Israel, after the flesh, saw nothing of this, it, nevertheless, justified God in abiding amongst them -- it "sanctified to the purifying of the flesh" (Hebrews 9: 13).<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus much as to Jehovah's position in this Book, which must be taken into account, in order to a proper understanding of the communications made therein.<a name=2:14></a> In them we shall find inflexible holiness united with the purest grace.<a name=2:15></a> God is holy, no matter from whence He speaks.<a name=2:16></a> He was holy on Mount Sinai, and holy above the mercy-seat; but, in the former case, His holiness stood connected with "a devouring fire;" in the latter, it was connected with patient grace.<a name=2:17></a> Now, the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		connection of perfect holiness with perfect grace is that which characterises the redemption which is in Christ Jesus, which redemption is, in various ways, shadowed forth in the Book of Leviticus.<a name=3:1></a> God must be holy, even though it should be in the eternal condemnation of impenitent sinners; but the full display of His holiness, in the salvation of sinners, calls forth heaven's loudest and loftiest note of praise.<a name=3:2></a> "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, Good-will toward men.<a name=3:3></a>" (Luke 2: 14.<a name=3:4></a>) This doxology could not have been sung in connection with "the fiery law.<a name=3:5></a>" No doubt, there was "glory to God in the highest," but there was no "Peace on earth" nor "good pleasure in men," inasmuch as it was the declaration of what men ought to be, ere God could take pleasure in them.<a name=3:6></a> But when "the Son" took His place, as a man, on the earth, the mind of Heaven could express its entire delight in Him as the One whose Person and work could combine, in the most perfect manner, divine glory with human blessedness.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, now, one word, as to the order of the offerings, in the opening chapters of the Book of Leviticus.<a name=3:8></a> The Lord begins with the burnt offering, and ends with the trespass offering.<a name=3:9></a> That is to say, He leaves off where we begin.<a name=3:10></a> This order is marked and most instructive.<a name=3:11></a> When, first, the arrow of conviction enters the soul, there are deep searchings of conscience, in reference to sins actually committed.<a name=3:12></a> Memory casts back its enlightened eye over the page of one's past life, and sees it stained with numberless trespasses against God and man.<a name=3:13></a> At this point of the soul's history, it is not so occupied with the question of the root from
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		whence those trespasses have sprung, as with the stern and palpable fact that such and such things have actually been committed; and, hence, it needs to know that God has provided a sacrifice through which "all trespasses" can be "frankly forgiven.<a name=4:1></a>" This is presented to us in the trespass offering.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, as one advances, in the divine life, he becomes conscious that those sins which he has committed are but branches from a root, streams from a fountain; and, moreover, that sin in his nature is that fountain -- that root.<a name=4:3></a> This leads to far deeper exercise, which can only be met by a deeper insight into the work of the cross.<a name=4:4></a> In a word, the cross will need to be apprehended by that in which God Himself has "condemned <i>sin in the flesh</i>," (Romans 8: 3) My reader will observe, it does not say, "sins in the flesh," but the root from whence these have sprung, namely, "<i>sin</i> in the <i>flesh</i>.<a name=4:5></a>" this is a truth of immense importance.<a name=4:6></a> Christ not merely "died for our <i>sins</i>, according to the scriptures," but He was "made <i>sin</i> for us.<a name=4:7></a>" (2 Corinthians 5: 21) This is the doctrine of the sin offering.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, it is when the heart and conscience are set at rest, through the knowledge of Christ's work, that we can feed upon Himself as the ground of our peace and joy, in the presence of God.<a name=4:9></a> There can be no such thing known as peace or joy, until we see all our trespasses forgiven and our sin judged.<a name=4:10></a> The trespass offering and the sin offering must be known, ere the Peace offering, joy offering, or thanksgiving offering can be appreciated.<a name=4:11></a> Hence, therefore, the order in which the peace offering stands, corresponds with the order of our spiritual apprehension of Christ.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same perfect order is observable in reference to the meat offering.<a name=5:1></a> When the soul is led to taste the sweetness of spiritual communion with Christ -- to feed upon Him, in peace and thankfulness, in the divine presence, it is drawn out in earnest desire to know more of the wondrous mysteries of His Person; and this desire is most blessedly met in the meat offering, which is the type of Christ's perfect manhood.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, in the burnt offering, we are conducted to a point beyond which it is impossible to go, and that is, the work of the cross, as accomplished under the immediate eye of God, and as the expression of the unswerving devotion of the heart of Christ.<a name=5:3></a> All these things will come before us, in beauteous detail, as we pass along; we are here only looking at the order of the offerings, which is truly marvellous, whichever way we travel, whether <i>outward</i> from God to us, or <i>inward</i> from us to God.<a name=5:4></a> In either case, we begin with the cross and end with the cross.<a name=5:5></a> If we begin with the burnt offering, we see Christ, on the cross, doing the will of God -- making atonement, according to the measure of His perfect surrender of Himself to God.<a name=5:6></a> If we begin with the trespass offering, we see Christ, on the cross, bearing our sins, and putting them away, according to the perfection of His atoning sacrifice; while, in each and all, we Behold the excellency, the beauty, and the perfection of His divine and adorable Person.<a name=5:7></a> Surely, all this is sufficient to awaken in our hearts the deepest interest in the study of those precious types which we shall now proceed to consider in detail.<a name=5:8></a> And may God the Holy Ghost, who penned the Book of Leviticus, expound its contents in living power to our hearts; that
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		so, when we have reached the close, we may have abundant cause to bless His name for many thrilling and soul-stirring views of the Person and work of our blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, to whom be glory, now, henceforth, and for evermore.<a name=6:1></a> Amen.<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the burnt offering, with which our book opens, we have a type of Christ "offering himself without spot to God.<a name=6:3></a>" Hence the position which the Holy Ghost assigns to it.<a name=6:4></a> If the Lord Jesus Christ came forth to accomplish the glorious work of atonement, His highest and most fondly-cherished object, in so doing, was the glory of God.<a name=6:5></a> "Lo, I come, to do thy will, O God," was the grand motto in every scene and circumstance of His life, and in none more markedly than in the work of the cross.<a name=6:6></a> Let the will of God be what it might, He came to do it.<a name=6:7></a> Blessed be God, we know what our portion is in the accomplishment of this "Will" for by it "we are sanctified, through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once.<a name=6:8></a>" (Hebrews 10: 10) Still, the primary aspect of Christ's work was to God-ward.<a name=6:9></a> It was an ineffable delight to Him to accomplish the will of God on this earth.<a name=6:10></a> No one had ever done this before.<a name=6:11></a> Some had, through grace, done "that which was right in the sight of the Lord;" but no one had ever, perfectly, invariably, from first to last, without hesitation, and without divergence, done the will of God.<a name=6:12></a> But this was, exactly, what the Lord Jesus did.<a name=6:13></a> He
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		was "obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.<a name=7:1></a>" (Philippians 2: 8) "He steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem.<a name=7:2></a>" And as He walked from the garden of Gethsemane to the cross of Calvary, the intense devotion of His heart told itself forth in these accents: "The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?<a name=7:3></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in all this self-emptied devotedness to God, there was truly a sweet savour.<a name=7:4></a> A perfect Man on the earth accomplishing the will of God, even in death, was an object of amazing interest to the mind of Heaven.<a name=7:5></a> Who could fathom the profound depths of that devoted heart, which displayed itself, under the eye of God, on the cross?<a name=7:6></a> Surely, none but God; for in this, as in everything else, it holds good that "no man knoweth the Son, but the Father;" and no one can know ought about Him, save as the Father reveals Him.<a name=7:7></a> The mind of man can, in some measure, grasp any subject of knowledge "under the sun.<a name=7:8></a>" Human science can be laid hold of by the human intellect; but no man knoweth the Son, save as the Father reveals Him, by the power of the Holy Ghost, through the written word.<a name=7:9></a> The Holy Ghost delights to reveal the Son -- to take of the things of Jesus, and show them unto us.<a name=7:10></a> These things we have, in all their fullness and beauty, in the word.<a name=7:11></a> There can be no new revelation, inasmuch as the Spirit brought "<i>all</i> things" to the apostles' memory, and led them into "<i>all</i> truth.<a name=7:12></a>" There can be nothing beyond "all truth;" and, hence, all pretension to a new revelation, and the development of new truth, -- meaning thereby truth not contained in the sacred canon of inspiration -- is an effort, on man's part, to add to what
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God calls "all truth.<a name=8:1></a>" No doubt, the Spirit may unfold and apply, with new and extraordinary power, truth contained in the word; but this is, obviously, a very different thing from our travelling outside the range of divine revelation, for the purpose of finding principles, ideas, or dogmas, which shall command the conscience.<a name=8:2></a> This latter can only be regarded in the light of impious presumption.<a name=8:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the gospel narrative, we have Christ presented to us in the varied phases of His character, His Person, and His work.<a name=8:4></a> To those precious documents the people of God in all ages have rejoiced to betake themselves, and drink in their heavenly revelations of the object of their love and confidence -- the One to whom they owed everything, for time and eternity.<a name=8:5></a> But very few, comparatively, have ever been led to regard the rites and ceremonies of the Levitical economy as fraught with the most minute instruction in reference to the same commanding theme.<a name=8:6></a> The offerings of Leviticus, for example, have been too much regarded as so many antiquated records of Jewish customs, conveying no intelligible voice to our ears -- no spiritual light to our understandings.<a name=8:7></a> However, it must be admitted that the apparently abstruse records of Leviticus, as well as the sublime strains of Isaiah.<a name=8:8></a> take their place amongst the "things which were written aforetime," and they are, therefore, "for Our learning.<a name=8:9></a>" True, we shall need to study those records, as indeed all Scripture, with an humble, self-emptied spirit; with reverent dependence upon the teaching of Him who graciously penned them for us; with sedulous attention to the general scope, bearing, and analogy of the entire body of divine

	<div class="paragraph">
		revelation; with an effectual curb on the imagination, that it may not take unhallowed flights; but if thus, through grace, we enter upon the study of the types of Leviticus, we shall find in them a vein of the richest and finest ore.<a name=9:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall now proceed to examine the burnt offering, which, as we have remarked, presents Christ, offering Himself, without spot, to God.<a name=9:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"If His offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male, without blemish.<a name=9:3></a>" The essential glory and dignity of Christ's Person form the basis of Christianity.<a name=9:4></a> He imparts that dignity and glory to every thing He does, and to every office He sustains, No office could possibly add glory to Him who is "God over all, blessed for ever" -- "God manifest in the flesh" -- the glorious "Immanuel" -- "God with us" -- the eternal Word -- the Creator and Sustainer of the universe.<a name=9:5></a> What office could add to the dignity of such an One?<a name=9:6></a> In point of fact, we know that all His offices are connected with His humanity; and in assuming that humanity, He stooped from the glory which He had with the Father, before the world was.<a name=9:7></a> He thus stooped, in order to glorify God perfectly, in the very midst of a scene where all was hostile to Him.<a name=9:8></a> He came to be "eaten up" by a holy, unquenchable zeal for the glory of God, and the effectual carrying out of His eternal counsels.<a name=9:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The unblemished male, of the first year, was a type of the Lord Jesus Christ offering Himself for the perfect accomplishment of the will of God.<a name=9:10></a> There should be nothing expressive either of weakness or imperfection.<a name=9:11></a> "A male of the first year" was required.<a name=9:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall see, when we come to examine the other offerings, that "a female" was, in some cases, permitted; but that was only expressive of the imperfection which attached to the worshipper's apprehension, and in nowise of any defect in the offering, inasmuch as it was "unblemished" in the one case, as well as in the other.<a name=10:1></a> Here, however, it was an offering of the very highest order, because it was Christ offering Himself to God.<a name=10:2></a> Christ, in the burnt offering, was exclusively for the eye and heart of God.<a name=10:3></a> This point should be distinctly apprehended.<a name=10:4></a> God alone could duly estimate the Person and work of Christ.<a name=10:5></a> He alone could fully appreciate the cross as the expression of Christ's perfect devotedness.<a name=10:6></a> The cross.<a name=10:7></a> as foreshadowed by the burnt offering, had an element in it which only the divine mind could apprehend.<a name=10:8></a> It had depths so profound that neither mortal nor angel could fathom them.<a name=10:9></a> There was a voice in it which was intended exclusively for, and went directly to, the ear of the Fat her.<a name=10:10></a> There were communications between the cross of Calvary and the throne of God, which lay far beyond the highest range of created intelligence.<a name=10:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"He shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord.<a name=10:12></a>" The use of the word "<i>voluntary</i>," here, brings out, with great clearness, the grand idea in the burnt offerings.<a name=10:13></a> It leads us to contemplate the cross in an aspect which is not sufficiently apprehended.<a name=10:14></a> We are too apt to look upon the cross merely as the place where the great question of sin was gone into and settled, between eternal Justice and the spotless victim -- as the place where our guilt was atoned for, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=11>[Page 11]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		where Satan was gloriously vanquished.<a name=11:1></a> Eternal and universal praise to redeeming love!<a name=11:2></a> The cross was all this.<a name=11:3></a> But it was more than this.<a name=11:4></a> It was the place where Christ's love to the Father was told out in language which only the Father could hear and understand.<a name=11:5></a> It is in the latter aspect that we have it typified, in the burnt offering; and, therefore, it is that the word voluntary" occurs.<a name=11:6></a> Were it merely a question of the imputation of sin, and of enduring the wrath of God on account of sin, such an expression would not be in moral order.<a name=11:7></a> The blessed Lord Jesus could not, with strict propriety, be represented as <i>willing</i> to be "made sin" -- <i>willing</i> to endure the wrath of God, and the hiding of His countenance; And, in this one fact, we learn, in the clearest manner, that the <i>burnt offering does not foreshadow Christ, on the cross, bearing sin</i> but Christ on the cross, accomplishing the will of God.<a name=11:8></a> that Christ Himself contemplated the cross in these two aspects of it, is evident from His own words.<a name=11:9></a> When he looked at the cross as the place of sin-bearing -- when He anticipated the horrors with which, in this point of view, it stood invested, He exclaimed, "Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me.<a name=11:10></a>" (Luke 23: 42) He shrank from that which His work, as a sin-bearer, involved.<a name=11:11></a> His pure and holy mind shrank from the thought of contact with sin; and His loving heart shrank from the thought of losing, for a moment, the light of God's countenance.<a name=11:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, then, the cross had another aspect.<a name=11:13></a> It stood before the eye of Christ as a scene, in which He could fully tell out all the deep secrets of His love to the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=12>[Page 12]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Father -- a place in which He could, "of his own voluntary will," take the cup which the Father had given Him, and drain it to the very dregs.<a name=12:1></a> True it is that the whole life of Christ emitted a fragrant odour, which ever ascended to the Father's throne -- He did always those things which pleased the Father -- He ever did the will of God; but the burnt offering does not typify Him in His life -- precious, beyond all thought, as was every act of that life -- but in His death, and in that, not as one "made a curse for us," but as one presenting to the heart of the Father an odour of incomparable fragrance.<a name=12:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This truth invests the cross with peculiar charms for the spiritual mind.<a name=12:3></a> It imparts to the sufferings of our blessed Lord an interest of the most intense character.<a name=12:4></a> The guilty sinner, no doubt, finds in the cross a divine answer to the deepest and most earnest cravings of heart and conscience.<a name=12:5></a> The true believer finds in the cross that which captivates every affection of his heart, and transfixes his whole moral being.<a name=12:6></a> The angels find in the cross a theme for ceaseless admiration.<a name=12:7></a> All this is true; but there is that, in the cross, which passes far beyond the loftiest conceptions of saints or angels; namely, the deep-toned devotion of the heart of the Son presented to, and appreciated by, the heart of the Father.<a name=12:8></a> This is the elevated aspect of the cross, which is so strikingly shadowed forth in the burnt offering.<a name=12:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, here, let me remark that the distinctive beauty of the burnt offering must be entirely sacrificed, if we admit the idea that Christ was a sin-bearer all His life.<a name=12:10></a> There would then be no force, no value, no meaning in the word "voluntary.<a name=12:11></a>" There could be no room for

	<div class="paragraph">
		voluntary action in the case of one who was compelled, by the very necessity of his position, to yield up his life.<a name=13:1></a> If Christ were a sin-bearer, in His life, then, assuredly, His death must have been a <i>necessary</i>, not a voluntary, act.<a name=13:2></a> Indeed, it may be safely asserted that there is not one of the offerings the beauty of which would not be marred, and its strict integrity sacrificed, by the theory of a <i>Life</i> of sin-bearing.<a name=13:3></a> In the burnt offering, this is especially the case, inasmuch as it is not, in it, a question of sin-bearing, or enduring the wrath of God, but entirely one of voluntary devotedness, manifested in the death of the cross.<a name=13:4></a> In the burnt offering we recognise a type of God the Son, accomplishing, by God the Spirit, the will of God the Father.<a name=13:5></a> This He did "of His own voluntary will.<a name=13:6></a>" "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.<a name=13:7></a>" (John 10: 17) Here we have the burnt offering aspect of the death of Christ.<a name=13:8></a> On the other hand, the prophet, contemplating Him as the sin offering, says, "his life is <i>taken</i> from the earth.<a name=13:9></a>" (Acts 8: 33, which is the LXX.<a name=13:10></a> version of Isaiah 53: 8) Again, Christ says, "No one (<i>ou deis</i>) taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.<a name=13:11></a>" Was He a sin-bearer when He said this?<a name=13:12></a> Observe, it is "no one" man, angel, devil, or else.<a name=13:13></a> It was His own voluntary act, to lay down His life that He might take it again.<a name=13:14></a> "I delight to do thy will, O my God.<a name=13:15></a>" Such was the language of the divine burnt offering -- of Him who found His unutterable joy in offering Himself without spot to God.<a name=13:16></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#22:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It may be well, at this point, to inform the reader that the Hebrew word which is rendered "burn," in the case of the burnt offering is wholly different from that which is used in the sin offering. I shall, because of the peculiar interest of the subject, refer to a few of the passages in which each word occurs. The word used in the burnt offering signifies "incense," or to "burn incense," and occurs in the following passages, in some one or other of its various inflections. Leviticus 6: 15; "and all the *frankincense*, ... . and shall *burn* it upon the altar." Deut, 33: 10; "they shall put *incense* before thee, and whole *burnt* sacrifice upon thine altar. Exodus 30: 1; "and thou shalt make an altar to *burn incense* upon." Psalm 46: 15; "with the incense of rams." Jeremiah 44: 21 "The *incense* that ye *burned* in the cities of Judah." Cant. 3: 15 Perfumed with Myrrh and *frankincense*." Passages might be multiplied, but the above will suffice to show the use of the word which occurs in the burnt offering. <p>The Hebrew word which is rendered "burn," in connection with the sin offering, signifies to burn, in general, and occurs in the following passages. Genesis 40: 3; "let us make brick, and *burn* them thoroughly." Leviticus 10: 16; "And Moses diligently sought the goat of the *sin* offering and, behold, it was *burnt*." 2 Chr. 16: 14; "And they made a very great *burning* for him." <p>Thus, not only was the sin offering burnt in a different place, but a different word is adopted by the Holy Ghost to express the burning of it. Now, we cannot imagine, for a moment, that this distinction is a mere interchange of words, the use of which is indifferent. I believe the wisdom of the Holy Ghost is as manifest in the use of the two words, as it is in any other point of difference in the two offerings. The spiritual reader will attach the proper value to the above most interesting distinction.

		It is well that the soul be clear as to this -- well to have a divine sense of the harmony which exists between those scriptures which present Christ in the essential dignity of His Person, and the divine purity of His nature, and those which present Him in His relation with His people, and as accomplishing the great work of redemption.<a name=41:6></a> At times we find both these things combined, in the same passage, as in Hebrews 5: 8, 9: "Though <i>he were a Son</i>, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him.<a name=41:7></a>" We must, however, bear in mind that not one of those relations into which Christ, voluntarily, entered -- whether as the expression of divine love to a lost world, or the servant of the divine counsels not one of these could possibly interfere with

		The next ingredient in the meat offering demanding our consideration is "the frankincense.<a name=47:1></a>" As has been remarked, the "fine flour" was the basis of the offering.<a name=47:2></a> The "oil" and "frankincense" were the two leading adjuncts; and, truly, the connection between these two latter is most instructive.<a name=47:3></a> The "oil" typifies the <i>power</i> of Christ's ministry; the "frankincense" typifies the <i>object</i> thereof.<a name=47:4></a> The former teaches us that He did everything by the Spirit of God; the latter that He did everything to the glory of God.<a name=47:5></a> The frankincense presents that in the life of Christ, which was, exclusively, for God.<a name=47:6></a> This is evident from the second verse: "And he shall bring it (the meat offering) to Aaron's sons, the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with <i>all the frankincense</i> thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord.<a name=47:7></a>" Thus was it in the true meat offering -- the Man Christ Jesus.<a name=47:8></a> There was that in His blessed life which was exclusively for God.<a name=47:9></a> Every thought, every word, every look, every act of His, emitted a fragrance which went up, immediately, to God.<a name=47:10></a> And, as in the type, it was the fire of the altar" that drew forth the sweet odour of the frankincense; so, in the Anti type, the more he was "tried," in all the scenes and circumstances of His blessed life, the more fully was it manifested that, in His manhood, there was nothing that could not ascend, as an odour of a sweet smell, to the throne of God.<a name=47:11></a> If, in the burnt offering, we behold Christ "offering himself, without spot, to God;" in the meat offering, we behold Him presenting all the intrinsic excellence

		It now only remains for us to consider an ingredient which was an inseparable adjunct of the meat offering, namely, "<i>salt</i>.<a name=48:4></a>" "and every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.<a name=48:5></a>" The expression, "salt of the covenant," sets forth the enduring character of that covenant.<a name=48:6></a> God Himself has so ordained it, in all things, that nought can ever alter it -- no influence can ever corrupt it.<a name=48:7></a> In a spiritual and practical point of view, it is impossible to over-estimate the value of such an ingredient.<a name=48:8></a> "Let your conversation be always with grace, seasoned with <i>salt</i>.<a name=48:9></a>" The whole conversation of the Perfect Man exhibited the power of this principle.<a name=48:10></a> His words were not merely words of grace, but words of pungent power -- words divinely adapted to preserve from all taint and corrupting influence.<a name=48:11></a> He never uttered a word which was not redolent with "frankincense" and seasoned with salt.<a name=48:12></a> The former was most acceptable to God, the latter most profitable for man.<a name=48:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So, also, in Luke 14, when His words of "grace" had drawn "great multitudes" after Him, He instantly throws in the "salt," by setting forth, in words of holy faithfulness, the sure results of following Him.<a name=49:3></a> Come, for all things are now ready," Here was the "grace.<a name=49:4></a>" but, then, "whosoever forsaketh not all that he hath, cannot be my disciple.<a name=49:5></a>" Here was the salt.<a name=49:6></a>" Grace is attractive; but "Salt is good.<a name=49:7></a>" Gracious discourse may be popular; but salted discourse never will.<a name=49:8></a> The pure gospel of the grace of God may, at certain times, and under certain circumstances, be run after by the multitude" for a while; but when the "salt" of a fervid and faithful application is introduced, it will soon thin the benches of all save such as are brought under the power of the word.<a name=49:9></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#52:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>How important to see, in the above beautiful passage, that doing God's will brings the soul into a relationship with Christ, of which His brethren according to the flesh knew nothing, on merely natural grounds. It was as true, with respect to those brethren, as any one else, that except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." Mary could not have been saved by the mere fact of her being the mother of Jesus. She needed personal faith in Christ as much as any other member of Adam's fallen family. She needed to pass, by being born again, not of the old creation into the new. It was by treasuring up Christ's words in her heart that this blessed woman was saved. No doubt, she was highly favoured" in being chosen as a vessel, to such a holy office; but, then, as a lost sinner, she needed! to rejoice in God her Saviour, like any one else. She stands on the same platform, is washed in the same blood, clothed in the same righteousness, and will sing the same song, as all the rest of God's redeemed. <p>This simple fact will give additional force and clearness to a point already stated, namely; that incarnation was not Christ's taking our nature into union with Himself. This truth should be carefully pondered. It is fully brought out in 2 Corinthians 5, "For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh, yea, *though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more*. Therefore if any man be *in Christ*, he is a new creation: old things are passed away; behold all things are become new" (verse 14-17).

The second point, in our theme, is the mode in which the meat offering was prepared.<a name=55:1></a> This was, as we read, by the action of fire.<a name=55:2></a> It was "baken in an oven" -- "baken in a pan" -- or "baken in a frying pan.<a name=55:3></a>" The process of baking suggests the idea of suffering.<a name=55:4></a> But inasmuch as the meat offering is called "a sweet savour" -- a term which is never applied to the sin offering, or trespass offering -- it is evident that there is no thought of suffering for sin -- no thought of suffering the wrath of God on account of sin -- no thought of suffering at the hand of infinite Justice, as the sinner's substitute.<a name=55:5></a> The two ideas of "sweet savour" and suffering for sin, are wholly incompatible, according to the Levitical economy.<a name=55:6></a> It would completely destroy the type of the meat offering, were we to introduce into it the idea of suffering for sin.<a name=55:7></a>

		Now, had He been bearing all these things by the necessity of His birth, or of His relations with Israel and the human family, we should have lost all the beauty and preciousness of His voluntary sympathy.<a name=59:9></a> There could be no room for voluntary action when absolute necessity was laid upon Him.<a name=59:10></a> But, on the other hand, when we see His entire freedom, both personally and relatively, from human misery and that which produced it, we can enter into that perfect grace and compassion which led Him to take our infirmities, and bear our sicknesses," in the power of true sympathy.<a name=59:11></a> There is, therefore, a very manifest difference between Christ's suffering as a voluntary sympathiser with human misery, and His sufferings as the sinner's substitute.<a name=59:12></a> The former are apparent throughout His entire <i>life</i>; the latter are confined to His <i>death</i>.<a name=59:13></a>

		It is of the utmost importance that we accurately distinguish between sin in the flesh, and sin on the conscience.<a name=76:3></a> If we confound these two, our souls must, necessarily, be unhinged, and our worship marred.<a name=76:4></a> An attentive consideration of 1 John 1: 8-10 will throw much light upon this subject, the understanding of which is so essential to a due appreciation of the entire doctrine of the peace offering, and more especially of that point therein at which we have now arrived.<a name=76:5></a> There is no one who will be so conscious of indwelling sin as the man who walks in the light.<a name=76:6></a> "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.<a name=76:7></a>" In the verse immediately preceding, we read, "the blood of Jesus Christ his Son Cleanseth us from <i>all sin</i>.<a name=76:8></a>" Here the distinction between sin in us, and sin on us, is fully brought out and established.<a name=76:9></a> To say that there is sin on the believer, in the presence of God, is to call in question the purging efficacy of the blood of Jesus, and to deny the truth of the divine record.<a name=76:10></a> If the blood of Jesus can perfectly purge, then the believer's conscience is perfectly purged.<a name=76:11></a> The word of God thus puts the matter; and we must ever remember that it is from God Himself we are to learn what the true condition of the believer is, in His sight.<a name=76:12></a> We are more disposed to be occupied in telling God

		There is an immense moral difference between praying for forgiveness, and confessing our sins, whether we look at it in reference to the character of God, the sacrifice of Christ, or the condition of the soul.<a name=79:2></a> It is quite possible that a person's prayer may involve the confession of his sin, whatever it may happen to be, and thus come to the same thing.<a name=79:3></a> But, then, it is always well to keep close to scripture, in what we think, and say, and do.<a name=79:4></a> It must be evident that when the Holy Ghost speaks of <i>confession</i>, He does not mean praying.<a name=79:5></a> And, it is equally evident that He knows there are moral elements in, and practical results flowing out of, confession, which do not belong to prayer.<a name=79:6></a> In point of fact, one has often found that a habit of importuning God for the forgiveness of sins, displayed ignorance as to the way in which God has revealed Himself in the Person and work of Christ; as to the relation in which the sacrifice of Christ has set the believer; and as to the divine mode of getting the conscience relieved from the burden, and purified from the soil, of sin.<a name=79:7></a>

May this truth be written on all our hearts, by the pen of God the Holy Ghost.

		Then, again, there is a style of praying for forgiveness, which involves a losing sight of the perfect ground of forgiveness, which has been laid in the sacrifice of the cross.<a name=81:4></a> If God forgives sins, He must be "faithful and just," in so doing.<a name=81:5></a> But it is quite clear that our prayers, be they ever so sincere and earnest, could not form the basis of God's faithfulness and justice, in forgiving us our sins.<a name=81:6></a> Nought save the work of the cross could do this.<a name=81:7></a> There the faithfulness and justice of God have had their fullest establishment, and that, too, in immediate reference to out actual sins, as well as to the root thereof, in our nature.<a name=81:8></a> God has already judged our sins in the Person of our Substitute, "on the tree;" and, in the act of confession, we judge ourselves.<a name=81:9></a> This is essential to divine forgiveness and restoration.<a name=81:10></a> The very smallest unconfessed, unjudged sin, on the conscience, will entirely mar our communion with God.<a name=81:11></a> Sin in us need not do this; but if we suffer sin to remain on us, we cannot have fellowship with God.<a name=81:12></a> He has put away our sins in such a manner, as that He can have us in His presence; and, so long as we abide in His presence, sin does not trouble

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, as to the difference between prayer and confession, as respects the condition of the heart before God, and its moral sense of the hatefulness of sin, it cannot, possibly, be over-estimated.<a name=82:4></a> It is a much easier thing to ask, in a general way, for the forgiveness of our sins than to confess those sins.<a name=82:5></a> Confession involves <i>self-judgement</i>; asking for forgiveness may not, and, in itself, does not.<a name=82:6></a> This alone would be sufficient to point out the difference.<a name=82:7></a> Self-judgement is one of the most valuable and healthful exercises of the Christian life; and, therefore, anything which produces it, must be highly esteemed by every earnest Christian.<a name=82:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The difference between asking for pardon, and confessing the sin, is continually exemplified in dealing with children.<a name=82:9></a> If a child has done anything wrong, he finds much less difficulty in asking his father to forgive him, than in openly and unreservedly confessing the wrong.<a name=82:10></a> In asking for forgiveness, the child may have in his mind a number of things which tend to lessen the sense of the evil; he may be secretly thinking that he was not so much to blame, after all, though, to be sure, it is only proper to ask his father to forgive him; whereas, in confessing the wrong, there is just the one thing, and that is self-judgement.<a name=82:11></a> Further, in asking for forgiveness the child may be influenced, mainly, by a desire to escape the consequences of his wrong;
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=83>[Page 83]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		whereas, a judicious parent will seek to produce a just sense of its moral evil, which can only exist in connection with the full confession of the fault -- in connection with self-judgement.<a name=83:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is, in reference to God's dealings with His children, when they do wrong.<a name=83:2></a> He must have the whole thing brought out and thoroughly judged.<a name=83:3></a> He will make us not only dread the consequences of sin which are unutterable -- but hate the thing itself, because of its hatefulness, in his sight.<a name=83:4></a> Were it possible for us, when we commit sin, to be forgiven, merely for the asking, our sense of sin, and our shrinking from it, would not be nearly so intense; and, as a consequence, our estimate of the fellowship with which we are blessed, would not be nearly so high.<a name=83:5></a> The moral effect of all this upon the general tone of our spiritual constitution, and also upon our whole character and practical career, must be obvious to every experienced Christian.<a name=83:6></a><a href="#83:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

His case in nowise interferes with the doctrine of 1 John 1: 9. He was not in the relationship of a child, and, as a consequence, not a subject of the advocacy. I would further add, that the subject of the Lord's prayer is by no means involved in what is stated above. I wish to confine myself to the immediate passage under consideration.

		In the light of the foregoing line of truth, we may easily see how much we err, when we imagine it to be a mark of spirituality to be occupied with our sins.<a name=85:3></a> Could sin or sins ever be the ground or material of our communion with God?<a name=85:4></a> Assuredly not.<a name=85:5></a> We have just seen that, so long as sin is the object before us, communion must be interrupted.<a name=85:6></a> Fellowship can only be "in the light;" and, undoubtedly, there is no sin in the light.<a name=85:7></a> There is nought to be seen there, save the blood which has put our sins away, and brought us nigh, and the Advocate which keeps us nigh.<a name=85:8></a> Sin has been for ever obliterated from that platform on which God and the worshipper stand in hallowed fellowship.<a name=85:9></a> What was it which constituted the material of communion between the Father and the prodigal?<a name=85:10></a> Was it the rags of the latter?<a name=85:11></a> Was it the husks of "the far country?<a name=85:12></a>" By no means.<a name=85:13></a> It was not anything that the prodigal brought with him.<a name=85:14></a> It was the rich provision of the Father's love -- "the fatted calf.<a name=85:15></a>" Thus it is with God and every true worshipper.<a name=85:16></a> They feed together, in holy and elevated communion, upon Him whose precious blood has brought them into everlasting association, in that light to which no sin can ever approach.<a name=85:17></a>

		Ere leaving this part of our subject, I would offer a remark as to the Lord's Supper, which, as being a prominent act of the Church's communion, may, with strict propriety, be looked at in connection with the doctrine of the peace offering.<a name=86:8></a> The intelligent celebration of the Lord's Supper must ever depend upon the recognition of its purely eucharistic or thanksgiving character.<a name=86:9></a> It is, very especially, a feast of thanksgiving -- thanksgiving for an accomplished redemption.<a name=86:10></a> "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?<a name=86:11></a> The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?<a name=86:12></a>" (1 Corinthians 10: 16) Hence, a soul, bowed down under the heavy burden of sin, cannot, with spiritual intelligence, eat the Lord's Supper, inasmuch as that feast is expressive of the complete removal of sin by the death of Christ.<a name=86:13></a> Ye do show the Lord's death till he come.<a name=86:14></a>" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>)

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the death of Christ, faith sees the end of everything that pertained to our old-creation standing; and, seeing that the Lord's Supper" shows forth" that death, it is to be viewed as the memento of the glorious fact that the believer's burden of sin was borne by One who put it away for ever.<a name=87:1></a> It declares that the chain of our sins, which once tied and bound us, has been eternally snapped by the death of Christ, and can never tie and bind us again.<a name=87:2></a> We gather round the Lord's table in all the joy of conquerors.<a name=87:3></a> We look back to the cross where the battle was fought and won; and we look forward to the glory where we shall enter into the full and eternal results of the victory.<a name=87:4></a>

		True, we have "leaven" <i>in</i> us; but we have no "uncleanness" <i>on</i> us.<a name=87:5></a> We are not to gaze upon our sins; but upon Him who bore them on the cross, and put them away for ever.<a name=87:6></a> We are not to "deceive ourselves" by the vain notion "that we have no sin" in us; nor are we to deny the truth of God's word, and the efficacy of Christ's blood, by refusing to rejoice in the precious truth that we have no sin on us, for "the blood Of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.<a name=87:7></a> It is truly deplorable to observe the heavy cloud that gathers round the Supper of the Lord, in the judgement of so many professing Christians.<a name=87:8></a> It tends, as much as anything else, to reveal the immense amount of misapprehension which obtains, in reference to the very elementary truths of the gospel.<a name=87:9></a> In fact, we know that when the Lord's Supper is resorted to on any ground save that of known salvation -- enjoyed forgiveness -- conscious deliverance, the soul becomes wrapped up in thicker and darker clouds than ever.<a name=87:10></a> That which is only

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How different from this is the beautiful ordinance of the peace offering!<a name=88:4></a> In this latter, looked at in its typical import, we see that the moment the blood was shed, God and the worshipper could feed in happy, peaceful fellowship.<a name=88:5></a> Nothing more was needed.<a name=88:6></a> Peace was established by the blood; and, on that ground, the communion proceeded.<a name=88:7></a> A single question as to the establishment of peace must be the death-blow to communion.<a name=88:8></a> If we are to be occupied with the vain attempt to make peace with God, we must be total strangers to either communion or worship.<a name=88:9></a> If the blood of the peace offering has not been shed, it is impossible that we can feed upon "the wave breast" or "the heave shoulder.<a name=88:10></a>" But if, on the other hand, the blood has been shed, then peace is made already.<a name=88:11></a> God Himself has made it, and this is enough for faith; and, therefore, by faith, we have fellowship with God, in the intelligence and joy of accomplished redemption.<a name=88:12></a> We taste the freshness of God's own joy in that which He has wrought.<a name=88:13></a> We feed upon Christ, in all the fullness and blessedness of God's presence.<a name=88:14></a>

		This latter point is connected with, and based upon, another leading truth laid down in "the law of the peace offering.<a name=88:15></a>" "And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered: he shall not leave any of it until the morning.<a name=88:16></a>" That is to say, the communion

		<a class="footnote" name="#95:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>There is this difference between the offering for "a ruler," and for "one of the common people:" in the former, it was "a male without blemish;" in the latter, "a female without blemish." The sin of a ruler would, necessarily, exert a wider influence than that of a common person; and, therefore, a more powerful application of the value of the blood was needed. In Leviticus 5: 13, we find cases demanding a still lower application of the sin offering -- cases of swearing and of touching any uncleanness, in which "the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour "was admitted as a sin offering. (See Leviticus 5: 11-13) What a contrast between the view of atonement presented by a ruler's bullock, and a poor man's handful of flour! And yet, in the latter, just as truly as in the former, we read, "it shall be forgiven him." <p>The reader will observe that Leviticus 5: 1-13, forms a part of Leviticus 6. Both are comprehended under one head, and present the doctrine of sin offering, in all its applications, from the bullock to the handful of flour. Each class of offering is introduced by the words, "And the Lord spake unto Moses." Thus, for example, the sweet savour offerings (Leviticus 1 - 3) are introduced by the words, "The Lord called unto Moses." These words are not repeated until Leviticus 4: 1, where they introduce the sin offering. They occur again at Leviticus 5: 14, where they introduce the trespass offering for wrongs done "in the holy things of the Lord;" and again at Leviticus 6: 1, where they introduce the trespass offering for wrong done to one's neighbour. <p>This classification is beautifully simple, and will help the reader to understand the different classes: of offering. As to the different grades in each class, whether "a bullock," "a ram," "a female," "a bird," "or "a handful of flour: they would seem to be so many varied applications of the same grand truth.

		This truth of one and the same Christ, whether in the burnt offering, or in the sin offering, is seen, not only in the fact that, in each case, the offering was "without blemish," but, also, in "the Law of the sin offering," where we read, "this is the law of the sin offering: in the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the Lord: it is most holy.<a name=101:4></a>" (Leviticus 6: 25) Both types point to one and the same great Antitype, though they present Him in such contrasted aspects of His work.<a name=101:5></a> In the burnt offering, Christ is seen meeting the divine affections; in the sin offering, He is seen meeting the depths of human need.<a name=101:6></a> That presents Him to us as the Accomplisher of the will of God; this, as the Bearer of the sin of man.<a name=101:7></a> In the former, we are taught the preciousness of the sacrifice; in the latter, the hatefulness of sin.<a name=101:8></a> Thus much, as to the two offerings, in the main.<a name=101:9></a> The most minute examination of the details will only tend to establish the mind in the truth of this general statement.<a name=101:10></a>

		Such is the wondrous truth illustrated by the ceremonial act of imposition of hands.<a name=106:4></a> When the worshipper had laid his hand upon the head of the burnt offering, it ceased to be a question as to what he was, or what he deserved, and became entirely a question of what the offering was in the judgement of Jehovah.<a name=106:5></a> If the offering was without blemish, so was the offerer; if the offering was accepted, so was the offerer.<a name=106:6></a> They are perfectly identified.<a name=106:7></a> The act of laying on of hands constituted them one, in God's view.<a name=106:8></a> He looked at the offerer through the medium of the offering.<a name=106:9></a> Thus it was, in the case of the burnt offering.<a name=106:10></a> But, in the sin offering, when the offerer had laid his hand upon the head of the offering, it became a question of what the offerer was, and what he deserved.<a name=106:11></a> The offering was treated according to the deserts of the offerer.<a name=106:12></a> They were perfectly identified.<a name=106:13></a> The act of laying on of hands constituted them one, in the judgement of God.<a name=106:14></a> The sin of the offerer was dealt with in the sin offering; the person of the offerer: was accepted in the burnt offering.<a name=106:15></a> This made a vast difference.<a name=106:16></a> Hence, though the act of laying on of hands was common to both types, and, moreover, though it was expressive, in the case of each, of identification, yet here the consequences as different as possible.<a name=106:17></a> The

		In the first chapter of this volume, we noticed the fact that "the sons of Aaron" are introduced in the burnt offering, but not in the sin offering.<a name=107:8></a> As priests they were privileged to stand around the altar, and behold the flame of an acceptable sacrifice ascending to the Lord.<a name=107:9></a> But in the sin offering, in its primary aspect, it was a question of the solemn judgement of sin, and not of priestly worship or admiration; and, therefore, the sons of Aaron do not appear.<a name=107:10></a> It is as convicted sinners that we have to do with Christ, as the Antitype of the sin offering.<a name=107:11></a> It is as worshipping priests, clothed in garments of salvation, that we contemplate Christ, as the Antitype of the burnt offering.<a name=107:12></a>

		should seek to apprehend; and, no doubt, they arise out of the special design of the divine mind in each offering.<a name=109:1></a> The sin offering sets forth that aspect of Christ's work in which He is seen taking, judicially, the place which belonged to us morally.<a name=109:2></a> For this reason we could not look for that intense expression of what He was, in all His secret springs of action, as unfolded in the typical act of "flaying.<a name=109:3></a>" Neither could there be that enlarged exhibition of what He was, not merely as a whole, but in the most minute features of His character, as seen in the act of "cutting it into his pieces.<a name=109:4></a>" Nor, yet, could there be that manifestation of what He was, personally, practically, and intrinsically, as set forth in the significant act of "washing the inwards and legs in water.<a name=109:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All these things belonged to the burnt-offering phase of our blessed Lord, and to that alone, because, in it, we see Him offering Himself to the eye, to the heart, and to the altar of Jehovah, without any question of imputed sin, of wrath, or of judgement.<a name=109:6></a> In the sin offering, on the contrary, instead of having, as the great prominent idea, what Christ is, we have what sin is.<a name=109:7></a> Instead of the preciousness of Jesus, we have the odiousness of sin.<a name=109:8></a> In the burnt offering, inasmuch as it is Christ Himself offered to, and accepted by, God, we have every thing done that could possibly make manifest what He was, in every respect.<a name=109:9></a> In the sin offering, because it is sin, as judged By God, the very reverse is the case.<a name=109:10></a> All this is so plain as to need no effort of the mind to understand it.<a name=109:11></a> It naturally flows out of the distinctive character of the type.<a name=109:12></a>

		and not what He was in Himself; there is, nevertheless, one rite connected with this type, which most fully expresses His personal acceptableness to Jehovah.<a name=110:1></a> This rite is laid down in the following words, "And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away, as it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offering; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering.<a name=110:2></a>" (Leviticus 4: 8-10) Thus, the intrinsic excellency of Christ is not omitted, even in the sin-offering.<a name=110:3></a> The fat burnt upon the altar is the apt expression of the divine appreciation of the preciousness of Christ's Person, no matter what place He might, in perfect grace, take, on our behalf or in our stead; He was made sin for us, and the sin offering is the divinely-appointed shadow of Him, in this respect.<a name=110:4></a> But, inasmuch as it was the Lord Jesus Christ, God's elect, His Holy One, His pure, His spotless, His eternal Son that was made sin, therefore the fat of the sin offering was burnt upon the altar, as a proper material for that fire which was the impressive exhibition of divine holiness.<a name=110:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, even in this very point, we see what a contrast there is between the sin offering and the burnt offering.<a name=110:6></a> In the case of the latter, it was not merely the fat, but the whole sacrifice that was burnt upon the altar, because it was Christ, without any question of sin-bearing whatever.<a name=110:7></a> in the case of the former, there was nothing but the fat to be burnt upon the altar, because it was

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having, thus, endeavoured to point out, in the first place, what was done with "the blood;" and, in the second place, what was done with "the fat;" we have, now, to consider what was done with "the flesh.<a name=111:7></a>" "And the skin of the bullock, and <i>all his flesh</i>.<a name=111:8></a>.<a name=111:9></a> even <i>the whole bullock</i> shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him On the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.<a name=111:10></a>" (verse 11, 12) In this act, we have the main feature of the sin offering-that which distinguished it both from the burnt offering and the peace offering.<a name=111:11></a> Its flesh was not burnt upon the altar, as in the burnt offering; neither was it eaten

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in comparing what was done with the "blood" with what was done with the "flesh" or "body" of the sacrifice, two great branches of truth present themselves to our view, namely, worship and discipleship.<a name=112:6></a> The blood brought into the sanctuary is the foundation of the former.<a name=112:7></a> The body burnt outside the camp is the foundation of the latter.<a name=112:8></a> Before ever we can worship, in Peace of conscience, and liberty of heart, we must know, on the authority of the word, and by the power of the Spirit, that the entire question of <i>sin</i> has been for ever settled by the blood of the divine sin offering-that His blood has been sprinkled, perfectly, before the Lord -- that all God's claims, and all our necessities, as ruined and guilty sinners, have been, for ever, answered.<a name=112:9></a> This gives perfect peace; and, in the enjoyment of this peace, we worship God.<a name=112:10></a> When an Israelite, of old, had offered his sin offering, his conscience was set at rest, in so far as the offering was capable of imparting rest.<a name=112:11></a>

		True, it was but a temporary rest, being the fruit of a temporary sacrifice.<a name=113:1></a> But, clearly, whatever kind of rest the offering was fitted to impart, that the offerer might enjoy.<a name=113:2></a> Hence, therefore, our Sacrifice being divine and eternal, our rest is divine and eternal also.<a name=113:3></a> As is the sacrifice such is the rest which is founded thereon.<a name=113:4></a> A Jew never had an eternally purged conscience, simply because he had not an eternally efficacious sacrifice.<a name=113:5></a> He might in a certain way, have his conscience purged for a day, a month, or a year; but he could not have it purged for ever.<a name=113:6></a> "But Christ being come, an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained <i>eternal</i> redemption.<a name=113:7></a> For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh; how much more shall the blood of Christ, who, through the eternal Spirit, offered Himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?<a name=113:8></a>" (Hebrews 11: 11-14).<a name=113:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, we have the full, explicit statement of the doctrine.<a name=113:10></a> The blood of goats and calves procured a temporary redemption; the blood of Christ procures eternal redemption.<a name=113:11></a> The former purified outwardly; the latter, inwardly.<a name=113:12></a> that purged the flesh, for a time; this, the conscience, for ever.<a name=113:13></a> The whole question hinges, not upon the character or condition of the offerer, but upon the value of the offering.<a name=113:14></a> The question is not, by any means, whether a Christian is a better man than a Jew, but whether the blood of Christ is better than the blood

		Now, why was the mind of a Jew set at rest, for the time being, when he had offered his sin offering?<a name=114:7></a> How did he know that the special sin for which he had brought his sacrifice was forgiven?<a name=114:8></a> Because God had said, "it shall be forgiven him.<a name=114:9></a>" His peace of heart, in reference to that particular sin, rested upon the testimony of the God of Israel, and the blood of the victim.<a name=114:10></a> So, now, the peace of the believer, in reference to "all SIN," rests upon the authority of God's word, and "the precious blood of Christ.<a name=114:11></a>" If a Jew had sinned, and neglected to bring his sin offering, he should have been "Cut Off from among his people;" but when he took his place as a sinner -- when he laid his hand upon the head of a sin offering, then, the offering was "Cut Off" instead of him, and he was free, so far.<a name=114:12></a> The offering was treated as the offerer deserved; and, hence, for him not to know that his sin was forgiven him, would have been to make God a liar, and to treat the blood of the divinely-appointed sin offering as nothing.<a name=114:13></a>

		Let us now proceed to compare the two classes of trespass offering; namely, the offering on account of trespass "in the holy things of the Lord," and that which had reference to a trespass committed in the common transactions and relations of human life.<a name=132:6></a> In so doing, we shall find one or two points which demand our attentive consideration.<a name=132:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, first, the expression, "if a soul sin through ignorance," which occurs in the former, is omitted in the latter.<a name=132:8></a> The reason of this is obvious.<a name=132:9></a> The claims which stand connected with the holy things of the Lord, must pass, infinitely, beyond the reach of the most elevated human sensibility.<a name=132:10></a> Those claims may be, continually, interfered with -- continually trespassed upon, and the trespasser not be aware of the fact.<a name=132:11></a> A man's consciousness can never be the regulator in the sanctuary of God.<a name=132:12></a> This is an unspeakable mercy.<a name=132:13></a> God's holiness alone must fix the standard, when God's rights are in question.<a name=132:14></a>

		Oh the other hand, the human conscience can readily grasp the full amount of a human claim, and can readily take cognisance of any interference with such claim.<a name=133:1></a> How often may we have wronged God, in His holy things, without ever taking a note of it in the tablet of conscience -- yea without having the competency to detect it.<a name=133:2></a> (See Malachi 3: 8) Not so, however, when man's rights are in question.<a name=133:3></a> The wrong which the human eye can see, and the human heart feel, the human conscience can take notice of.<a name=133:4></a> A man, "through ignorance" of the laws which governed the sanctuary of old, might commit a trespass against those laws, without being aware of it, until a higher light had shone in upon his conscience.<a name=133:5></a> But a man could not, "through ignorance," tell a lie, swear falsely, commit an act of violence, deceive his neighbour, or find a lost thing and deny it.<a name=133:6></a> These were all plain and palpable acts, lying within the range of the most sluggish sensibility.<a name=133:7></a> Hence it is that the expression, "through ignorance" is introduced, in reference to "the holy things of the Lord," and omitted, in reference to the common affairs of men.<a name=133:8></a> How blessed it is to know that the precious blood of Christ has settled all questions whether with respect to God or man -- our sins of ignorance or our known sins!<a name=133:9></a> Here lies the deep and settled foundation of the believer's peace.<a name=133:10></a> The cross has divinely met ALL.<a name=133:11></a>

		Again, when it was a question of trespass "in the holy things of the Lord," the unblemished sacrifice was first introduced; and, afterward "the principal" and "the fifth.<a name=133:12></a>" This order was reversed when it was a question of the common affairs of life.<a name=133:13></a> (Comp.<a name=133:14></a> <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#5:15">Leviticus  5:15</a>, 16 with <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#6:4">Leviticus  6:4</a>-7)

		The reason of this is equally obvious.<a name=134:1></a> When the divine rights were infringed, the blood of atonement was made the great prominent matter.<a name=134:2></a> Whereas, when human rights were interfered with, restitution would naturally assume the leading place in the mind.<a name=134:3></a> But, inasmuch as the latter involved the question of the soul's relation with God, as well as the former, therefore the sacrifice is introduced, though it be last in order.<a name=134:4></a> If I wrong my fellow man, that wrong will, undoubtedly, interfere with my communion with God; and that communion can only be restored on the ground of atonement.<a name=134:5></a> Mere restitution would not avail.<a name=134:6></a> It might satisfy the injured man, but it could not form the basis of restored communion with God.<a name=134:7></a> I might restore "the principal" and add "the fifth," ten thousand times over, and yet my sin remain, for "Without shedding of blood is no remission.<a name=134:8></a>" (Hebrews 9: 22) Still, if it be a question of injury done to my neighbour, then restitution must first be made.<a name=134:9></a> "If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.<a name=134:10></a>" (Matthew 5: 23, 24)<a href="#134:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#134:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>From a comparison of Matthew 5.23, 24 with Matthew 18. 21, 22, we may learn a fine principle, as to the way in which wrongs and injuries are to be settled between two brothers. The injurer is sent back from the altar, in order to have his matters set straight with the injured one; for there can be no communion with the Father so long as my brother "hath ought against me" But, then, mark the beauteous way in which the injured one is taught to receive the injurer. "Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, until seven times; but, *until seventy times seven*." Such is the divine mode of settling all questions between brethren. "Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye (Colossians 3: 13).

		"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread; and gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=145:2></a> And Moses did as the Lord commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=145:3></a>" There is special grace unfolded here.<a name=145:4></a> The whole assembly is convened at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, in order that all might have the privilege of beholding the one who was about to be entrusted with the charge of their most important interests.<a name=145:5></a> In Ex 28 and 29 we are taught the same general truth with respect to the vestments and sacrifices connected with the priestly office; but, in Leviticus, the congregation is introduced, and allowed to look on at every movement in the solemn and impressive Service of consecration.<a name=145:6></a> The humblest member of the assembly had his own place.<a name=145:7></a> Each one, the lowest as well as the highest, was permitted to gaze upon the person of the high priest, upon the sacrifice which he offered, and upon the robes which he wore.<a name=145:8></a> Each one had his own peculiar need, and the God of Israel would have each to see and know that his need was fully provided for by the varied qualifications of the high priest who stood before him.<a name=145:9></a> Of these qualifications the priestly robes were the apt typical expression.<a name=145:10></a> Each portion of the dress was designed and adapted to put forth some special qualification in which the assembly

		Thus it is the believer can, with the eye of faith, behold his great High Priest, in the heavens, and see in Him the divine realities of which the Aaronic vestments were but the shadows.<a name=146:3></a> The Lord Jesus Christ is the holy One, the anointed One, the mitred One, the girded One.<a name=146:4></a> He is all these, not in virtue of outward garments to be put on or off, but in virtue of the divine and eternal graces of His Person, the changeless efficacy of His work, and the imperishable virtue of His sacred offices.<a name=146:5></a> This is the special value of studying the types of the Mosaic economy.<a name=146:6></a> The enlightened eye sees Christ in all.<a name=146:7></a> The blood of the sacrifice and the robe of the high priest both point to Him -- both were designed of God to set Him forth.<a name=146:8></a> If it be a question of conscience, the blood of the sacrifice meets it, according to the just claims of the sanctuary.<a name=146:9></a> Grace has met the demand of holiness.<a name=146:10></a> And, then, if it be a question of the need connected with the believer's position down here, he can see it all divinely answered in the official robes of the high priest.<a name=146:11></a>

		In looking into the contents of the chapters which lie open before us, we may remark three things put prominently forward, namely, the authority of the word, the value of the blood, the power of the Spirit.<a name=148:3></a> These are weighty matters -- matters of unspeakable importance -- matters which must be regarded, by every Christian, as, unquestionably, vital and fundamental.<a name=148:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And, first, as to the authority of the word, it is of the deepest interest to see that, in the consecration of the priests, as well as in the entire range of the sacrifices, we are brought immediately under the authority of the word of God.<a name=148:5></a> "And Moses said unto the congregation, <i>This is the thing which the Lord</i> commanded to be done.<a name=148:6></a>" (Leviticus 8: 5) And, again, "Moses said, <i>This is the thing which the Lord</i> commanded that ye should do: <i>and the glory of the Lord shall appear unto you</i>.<a name=148:7></a>" (Leviticus 9: 6) Let these words sink down into our ears.<a name=148:8></a> Let them be carefully and prayerfully pondered.<a name=148:9></a> They are priceless words.<a name=148:10></a> "<i>This</i> is <i>the</i> thing which <i>the Lord</i> commanded.<a name=148:11></a>" He did not say, "This is the thing which is expedient, agreeable, or suitable.<a name=148:12></a>" Neither did He say, "This is the thing

		<a class="footnote" name="#169:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Lest any reader should be troubled with a difficulty in reference to the souls of Nadab, and Abihu, I would say that no such question ought ever to be raised. In such cases as Nadab and Abihu, in Leviticus 10; Korah and his company, in Numbers 16; the whole congregation, Joshua and Caleb excepted, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness, Numbers 14 and Hebrews 3; Achan and his family, Joshua 7; Ananias and Sapphira, Acts 5; those who were judged for abuses at the Lord's table, 1 Corinthians 11. In all such cases, the question of the soul's salvation is never raised. We are simply called to see, in them, the solemn actings of God, in government in the midst of His people. This relieves the mind from all difficulty. Jehovah dwelt, of old, between the Cherubim, to judge His people in everything; and God the Holy Ghost dwells, now, in the church, to order and govern, according to the perfection of His presence. He was so really and personally present that Ananias and Sapphira could lie to Him, and He could execute judgement upon them. It was as positive and as immediate an exhibition of His actings in government as we have in the matter of Nadab and Abihu, or Achan, or any other. <p>This is a great truth to get hold of. God is not only for His people, but with them, and in them. He is to be counted upon, for everything, whether it be great or small. He is present to comfort and help. He is there to chasten and judge. He is there "for exigence of every hour. He is sufficient. Let faith count upon Him. "Where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I." (Matthew 18: 20) And, assuredly, where He is, we want no more.

But, be this as it may, we have to be thankful for a most valuable principle, in reference to our conduct, as spiritual priests. We are to refrain from everything which would produce the same effect upon our spiritual man, as strong drink produces upon the physical man. <p>It needs hardly to be remarked that the Christian should be *most jealous* over himself as to the use of wine or strong drink. Timothy, as we know, needed an apostolic recommendation to induce him even to touch it, for his health's sake. (1 Timothy 5) A beauteous proof of Timothy's habitual self-denial, and of the thoughtful love of the Spirit, in the apostle. I must confess that one's moral sense is offended by seeing Christians making use of strong drink in cases where it is, very manifestly, not medicinal. I rarely, if ever, see a spiritual person indulge in such a thing. One trembles to see a Christian the mere slave of a habit, whatever that habit may be. It proves that he is not keeping his body in subjection, and he is in great danger of being "disapproved" (1 Corinthians 9: 27).

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Book of Leviticus may be termed "the priest's guide book.<a name=184:5></a>" This is very much its character.<a name=184:6></a> It is full of principles for the guidance of such as desire to live in the enjoyment of priestly nearness to God.<a name=184:7></a> Had Israel gone on with Jehovah, according to the grace in which He had brought them up, out of the land of Egypt, they should have been to Him "a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.<a name=184:8></a>" (Exodus 19: 6) This, however, they failed to do.<a name=184:9></a> They put themselves at a distance.<a name=184:10></a> They got under law and failed to keep it.<a name=184:11></a> Hence, Jehovah had to take up a certain tribe, and from that tribe a certain family, and from that family a certain man, and to him and to his house, was granted the high privilege of drawing nigh, as priests unto God.<a name=184:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The foregoing train of thought is awakened by the perusal of the eleventh chapter of the Book of Leviticus.<a name=188:4></a> Therein we find Jehovah entering, in most marvellous detail, into a description of beasts, birds, fishes, and reptiles, and furnishing His people with various marks by which they were to know what was clean and what was unclean.<a name=188:5></a> We have the summing up of the entire contents of this remarkable chapter in the two closing verses.<a name=188:6></a> "This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth; <i>to make a difference</i> between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.<a name=188:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With regard to beasts, two things were essential to render them clean, they should chew the cud and divide the hoof.<a name=188:8></a> "Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is cloven footed, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that shall ye eat.<a name=188:9></a>" Either of these marks would, of itself, have been wholly insufficient to constitute ceremonial cleanness.<a name=188:10></a> The two should go together.<a name=188:11></a> Now,

	<div class="paragraph">
		while these two marks were quite sufficient for the guidance of an Israelite, as to the cleanness or uncleanness of an animal, without any reference as to why or wherefore such marks were given, or what they meant, yet is the Christian permitted to enquire into the spiritual truth wrapped up in these ceremonial enactment's.<a name=189:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What, then, are we to learn from those two features in a clean animal?<a name=189:2></a> The chewing of the cud expresses the natural process of "inwardly digesting" that which one eats; while the divided hoof sets forth the character of one's outward walk.<a name=189:3></a> There is, as we know, an intimate connection between the two, in the christian life.<a name=189:4></a> The one who feeds upon the green pastures of the Word of God, and inwardly digests what he takes in -- the one who is enabled to combine calm meditation with prayerful study, will, without doubt, manifest that character of outward walk which is to the praise of Him who has graciously given us His word to form our habits and govern our ways.<a name=189:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to be feared that many who <i>read the Bible</i> do not <i>digest the word</i>.<a name=189:6></a> The two things are widely different.<a name=189:7></a> One may read chapter after chapter, book after book, and not digest so much as a single line.<a name=189:8></a> We may read the Bible as part of a dull and profitless routine; but, through lack of the ruminating powers -- the digestive organs, we derive no profit whatsoever.<a name=189:9></a> This should be carefully looked into.<a name=189:10></a> The cattle that browse on the green may teach us a wholesome lesson.<a name=189:11></a> They, first, diligently gather up the refreshing pasture, and then calmly lie down to chew the cud.<a name=189:12></a> Striking and beautiful picture of a Christian feeding upon and inwardly digesting the precious contents of the volume

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same caution is needful in reference to the public exposition of the Word.<a name=190:4></a> Let those who expound Scripture to their fellows, first feed and digest for themselves.<a name=190:5></a> Let them read and ruminate, in private, not merely for others, but for themselves.<a name=190:6></a> It is a poor thing for a man to be continually occupied in procuring food for other people, And he himself dying of starvation.<a name=190:7></a> Then, again, let those who attend upon the public ministry of the Word, see that they are not doing so mechanically, as by the force of mere religious habit, but with an earnest desire to "read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest" what they hear.<a name=190:8></a> Then will both teachers and taught be well-conditioned, the spiritual life nourished and sustained, and the true character of outward walk exhibited.<a name=190:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, be it remembered, that the chewing of the cud must never be separated from the divided hoof.<a name=190:10></a> If one but partially acquainted with the priest's guide book -- unpractised in the divine ceremonial, happened to see an animal chewing the cud, he might hastily pronounce him clean.<a name=190:11></a> This would have been a serious error.<a name=190:12></a> A more careful reference to the divine directory would, at once, show that he must mark the animal's walk -- that he must note the impression made by each movement -- that he must look for the result of the divided hoof.<a name=190:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In like manner, the divided hoof was insufficient, if not accompanied by the chewing of the cud.<a name=191:4></a> "The swine, though he divide the hoof, and be cloven footed, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.<a name=191:5></a>" (verse 7) In a word, then, the two things were inseparable in the case of every clean animal; and, as to the spiritual application, it is of the very last importance, in a practical point of view.<a name=191:6></a> The inward life and the outward walk must go together.<a name=191:7></a> A man may profess to love and feed upon -- to study and ruminate over the Word of God -- the pasture of the soul; but, if his footprints along the pathway of life are not such as the Word requires, he is not clean.<a name=191:8></a> And, on the other hand, a man may seem to walk with pharisaic blamelessness; but if his walk be not the result of the hidden life, it is worse than worthless.<a name=191:9></a> There must be the divine principle within which feeds upon and digests the rich pasture of God's Word, else the impression of the footstep will be of no avail.<a name=191:10></a> The value of each depends upon its inseparable connection with the other.<a name=191:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We are, here, forcibly reminded of a solemn passage in the First Epistle of John, in which the apostle furnishes us with the two marks whereby we may know those that are of God.<a name=191:12></a> "In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever <i>doeth not righteousness</i>, is not of God, neither he that <i>loveth not his brother</i>.<a name=191:13></a>" (1 John 3: 10) Here we have the two grand characteristics of the eternal life, of which

		all true believers are possessed, namely, "righteousness" and "love".<a name=192:1></a> The outward and the inward.<a name=192:2></a> Both must be combined.<a name=192:3></a> Some professing Christians are all for love, so called; and some for righteousness.<a name=192:4></a> Neither can exist, in a divine way, without the other.<a name=192:5></a> If that which is called love exist without practical righteousness, it will, in reality, be but a lax, soft, easy-going habit of mind, which will tolerate all manner of error and evil.<a name=192:6></a> And, if that which is called righteousness exist without love, it will be a stern, proud, pharisaic, self-sufficient temper of soul resting upon the miserable basis of personal reputation.<a name=192:7></a> But where the divine life is in energy, there will ever be the inward charity combined with genuine practical righteousness.<a name=192:8></a> The two elements are essential in the formation of true Christian character.<a name=192:9></a> There must be the love that will express itself in reference to the very feeblest development of that which is of God; and, at the same time, the holiness that shrinks, with intense abhorrence, from all that is of Satan.<a name=192:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall now pass on to the consideration of that which the Levitical ceremonial taught with respect to "all that are in the waters.<a name=192:11></a>" Here again, we find the double mark.<a name=192:12></a> "These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.<a name=192:13></a> And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you.<a name=192:14></a>" (verse 9, 10) Two things were necessary to render a fish ceremonially clean, namely, "fins and scales," which, obviously, set forth a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, doubtless, there was more than this.<a name=193:2></a> I believe it is our privilege to discern, in the natural properties with which God has endowed those creatures which move in the waters, certain spiritual qualities which belong to the Christian life.<a name=193:3></a> If a fish needs a "fin" to enable him to move through the waters and "scales" to resist the action thereof, so does the believer need that spiritual capacity which enables him to move onward through the scene with which he is surrounded, and, at the same time, to resist its influence -- to prevent its penetrating -- to keep it out.<a name=193:4></a> These are precious qualities.<a name=193:5></a> The fin and the scale are pregnant with meaning -- full of practical instruction to the Christian.<a name=193:6></a> They exhibit to us, in ceremonial garb, two things which we specially need, namely, spiritual energy to move onward through the element which surrounds us, and the power to preserve us from its action.<a name=193:7></a> The one will not avail without the other.<a name=193:8></a> It is of no use to possess a capacity to get on, through the world, if we are not proof against the world's influence; and though we may seem to be able to keep the world out, yet if He have not the motive power, we are defective.<a name=193:9></a> The "fins" would not do without the "scales," nor the "scales" without the "fins" Both were required, to render a fish ceremonially clean; and we, in order to be properly equipped, require to be encased against the penetrating influence of an evil world; and, at the same time, to be furnished with a capacity to pass rapidly on.<a name=193:10></a>

		It is important to see that, while the broad principles of leprosy and its cleansing apply, in a secondary sense, to any sinner, yet, in the scripture now before us, the matter is presented in connection with those who were God's recognised people.<a name=210:4></a> The person who is here seen as the subject of priestly examination, is a member of the assembly of God.<a name=210:5></a> It is well to apprehend this.<a name=210:6></a> God's assembly must be kept pure, because it is His dwelling-place.<a name=210:7></a> No leper can be allowed to remain within the hallowed precincts of Jehovah's habitation.<a name=210:8></a>

		But, then, mark the care, the vigilance, the perfect patience, inculcated upon the priest, lest ought that was not leprosy might be treated as such, or lest ought that really was leprosy might be suffered to escape.<a name=210:9></a> Many things might appear "in the skin" -- the place of manifestation" -- like the plague of leprosy," which, upon patient, priestly investigation, would be found to be merely superficial.<a name=210:10></a> This was to be carefully attended to.<a name=210:11></a> Some blemish might make its appearance, upon the surface, which, though demanding the jealous care of the one who had to act for God, was not, in reality,

		Now, there is a rich fund of instruction in all this for the people of God.<a name=211:6></a> There is a difference between personal infirmity and the positive energy of evil -- between mere defects and blemishes in the outward character, and the activity of sin in the members.<a name=211:7></a> No doubt, it is important to watch against our infirmities; for, if not watched, judged, and guarded against, they may become the source of positive evil.<a name=211:8></a> (See verse 14-25) Everything of nature must be judged and kept down.<a name=211:9></a> We must not make any allowance for personal infirmity, <i>in ourselves</i>, though we should make ample allowance for it <i>in others</i>.<a name=211:10></a> Take, for example, the matter of an irritable temper.<a name=211:11></a> I should judge it in myself; I should make allowance for it in another.<a name=211:12></a> It may, like "the burning boil," in the case of an Israelite, (verse 19, 20,) prove the source of real defilement -- the ground of exclusion from the assembly.<a name=211:13></a> Every form of weakness must be watched, lest it become an occasion of sin.<a name=211:14></a> "A bald forehead" was not leprosy, but it was that in which leprosy might appear, and, hence, it had to be watched.<a name=211:15></a> There may be a hundred things which are not, in themselves, sinful, but which may become the

		LEVITICUS 15
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter treats of a variety of ceremonial uncleannesses of a much less serious nature than leprosy.<a name=249:1></a> This latter would seem to be presented as the expression of the deep-seated energy of nature's evil; whereas, chapter 15 details a number of things which are merely unavoidable infirmities, but which, as being, in any measure the outflow of nature, were defiling, and needed the provisions of divine grace.<a name=249:2></a> The divine presence in the assembly demanded a high order of holiness and moral purity.<a name=249:3></a> Every movement of nature had to be counteracted.<a name=249:4></a> Even things which, so far as man was concerned, might seem to be unavoidable weaknesses, had a defiling influence, and required cleaning, because Jehovah was in the camp.<a name=249:5></a> Nothing offensive, nothing unsightly, nothing in any way uncomely, should be suffered within the pure, unsullied and sacred precincts of the presence of the God of Israel.<a name=249:6></a> The uncircumcised nations around would have understood nothing of such holy ordinances; but Jehovah would have Israel holy, because He was Israel's God.<a name=249:7></a> If they were to be privileged and distinguished by having the presence of a holy God, they would need to be a holy people.<a name=249:8></a>

		This, to an uncircumcised person, would have proved an intolerable burden.<a name=250:6></a> For such an one to have a God of infinite holiness about his path, by day, and about his bed, by night, would have involved an amount of restraint beyond all power of endurance; but to a true lover of holiness, a lover of God, nothing; could be more delightful.<a name=250:7></a> Such an one rejoices in the sweet assurance that God is always near; and he delights in the holiness which is, at once, demanded and secured by the presence of God.<a name=250:8></a>

		Do you ask, "what am I to learn from such a section of Scripture?<a name=251:1></a> What is its application to me?<a name=251:2></a>' In the first place, let me ask, do you not admit that it was written for your learning?<a name=251:3></a> This, I imagine, you will not question, seeing the inspired apostle so expressly declare that, "whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning.<a name=251:4></a>" (Romans15: 4) Many seem to forget this important statement, at least, in so far as the book of Leviticus is concerned.<a name=251:5></a> They cannot conceive it possible, that they are to learn ought from the rites and ceremonies of a by-gone age, and particularly from such rites and ceremonies as the fifteenth of Leviticus records.<a name=251:6></a> But, when we remember, that God the Holy Ghost has written this very chapter -- that every paragraph, every verse, every line of it "is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable," it should lead us to inquire what it means.<a name=251:7></a> Surely, what God has written His child should read.<a name=251:8></a> No doubt, there is need of spiritual power to know <i>how</i>, and spiritual wisdom to know <i>when</i>, to read such a chapter; but the same holds good with respect to any chapter.<a name=251:9></a> One thing is certain, if we were sufficiently spiritual, sufficiently heavenly, sufficiently abstracted from nature, and elevated above earth, we should deduce nought but purely spiritual principles and ideas from this and kindred chapters.<a name=251:10></a> If an angel from heaven were to read such sections, how should he regard them?<a name=251:11></a> Only in a spiritual and heavenly light; only as the depositories of the purest and highest morality.<a name=251:12></a> And why should not we do the same?<a name=251:13></a> I believe we are not aware of what positive contempt we pour upon the sacred Volume by suffering any portion of it to be so grossly

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No doubt, spiritual wisdom, holy discernment, and that refined moral sense, which only communion with God can impart -- all these things would be needed in order to form a judgement as to when such scripture ought to be read.<a name=252:4></a> We should feel strongly disposed to question the sound judgement and refined taste of a man, who could stand up and read the fifteenth of Leviticus, in the midst of an ordinary congregation.<a name=252:5></a> But why?<a name=252:6></a> Is it because it is not "divinely inspired," and, as such, "profitable?<a name=252:7></a>" By no means; but because the generality of persons are not sufficiently spiritual to enter into its pure and holy lessons.<a name=252:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What, then, are we to learn from the chapter before us?<a name=252:9></a> In the first place, we learn to watch, with holy jealousy, everything that emanates from nature.<a name=252:10></a> Every movement of, and every emanation from, nature is defiling.<a name=252:11></a> Fallen human nature is an impure fountain, and all its streams are polluting.<a name=252:12></a> It cannot send forth ought that is pure, holy, or good.<a name=252:13></a> This is a lesson frequently inculcated in the Book of Leviticus, and it is impressively taught in this chapter.<a name=252:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, blessed be the grace that has made such ample provision for nature's defilement!<a name=252:15></a> This provision is presented under two distinct forms, throughout the entire of the book of God, and throughout this section of it in

		particular -- namely, "water and blood.<a name=253:1></a>" Both these are founded upon the death of Christ.<a name=253:2></a> The blood that expiates and the water that cleanses flowed from the pierced side of a crucified Christ.<a name=253:3></a> (Comp.<a name=253:4></a> John 19: 34, with 1 John 5: 6) "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.<a name=253:5></a>" (1 John 1: 7) And the word of God cleanseth our practical habits and ways.<a name=253:6></a> (Psalm119: 9; Ephesians5: 26) Thus, we are maintained in fitness for communion and worship, though passing through a scene where all is defiling, and carrying with us a nature, every movement of which leaves a soil behind.<a name=253:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has been already remarked that our chapter treats of a class of ceremonial defilement's less serious than leprosy.<a name=253:8></a> This will account for the fact that atonement is here foreshadowed, not by a bullock or a lamb, but by the lowest order of sacrifice -- namely, "two turtle doves.<a name=253:9></a>" But, on the other hand, the cleansing virtue of the Word is continually introduced, in the ceremonial actions of "washing," "bathing," and "rinsing.<a name=253:10></a>" "Wherewithal shall a young man <i>cleanse</i> his way?<a name=253:11></a> By taking heed thereto according to thy <i>word</i>.<a name=253:12></a>" "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for it; that he might <i>sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word</i>.<a name=253:13></a>" Water held a most important place in the Levitical system of purification, and, as a type of the Word, nothing can be more interesting or instructive.<a name=253:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we can gather up the most valuable points from this fifteenth chapter of Leviticus.<a name=253:15></a> We learn, in a very striking manner, the intense holiness of the divine presence.<a name=253:16></a> Not a soil, not a stain, not a speck can be

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, we learn that human nature is the overflowing fountain of uncleanness.<a name=254:3></a> It is hopelessly defiled; and not only defiled, but defiling.<a name=254:4></a> Awake or asleep, sitting, standing, or lying, nature is defiled and defiling.<a name=254:5></a> Its very touch conveys pollution.<a name=254:6></a> This is a deeply-humbling lesson for proud humanity; but thus it is.<a name=254:7></a> The Book of Leviticus holds up a, faithful mirror to nature.<a name=254:8></a> It leaves "flesh" nothing to glory in.<a name=254:9></a> Men may boast of their refinement, their moral sense, their dignity.<a name=254:10></a> Let them study the third book of Moses, and there they will see what it is all really worth, in God's estimation.<a name=254:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, we learn, afresh, the expiatory value of the blood of Christ, and the cleansing, purifying, sanctifying virtues of the precious word of God.<a name=254:12></a> When we think of the unsullied purity of the sanctuary, and then reflect upon nature's irremediable defilement, and ask the question, "However can we enter and dwell there?<a name=254:13></a>" the answer is found in" the blood and water" which flowed from the side of a crucified Christ -- a Christ who gave up His life unto death for us, that we might live by Him.<a name=254:14></a> "There are three that bear record in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and," blessed be God," these three agree in one.<a name=254:15></a>" The Spirit does not convey to our ears a message diverse from that which we find in the Word; and both the Word and the Spirit declare to us the preciousness and efficacy of the blood.<a name=254:16></a>

		In this great and practically-important fact, Jehovah set before His people a ground of conduct which was immovable, and a standard of morality which was as elevated, and as enduring, as the eternal throne itself.<a name=287:2></a> The moment He entered into a relationship with a people, their ethics were to assume a character and tone worthy of Him.<a name=287:3></a> It was no longer a question as to what they were, either in themselves or in comparison with others; but of what God was in comparison with all.<a name=287:4></a> This makes a material difference.<a name=287:5></a> To make <i>self</i> the ground of action or the standard of ethics is not only presumptuous folly, but it is sure to set one upon a descending scale of action.<a name=287:6></a> If self be my object, I must, of necessity, sink lower and lower every day; but if, on the other hand, I set the Lord before me, I shall rise higher and higher as, by the power of the Holy Ghost, I grow in conformity to that perfect model which is unfolded to the gaze of faith in the sacred pages of inspiration.<a name=287:7></a> I shall, undoubtedly, have to prostrate myself in the dust, under a sense of how infinitely short I come of the mark set before me; but, then, I can never consent to the setting up of a lower standard, nor can I ever be satisfied until I am conformed in all things to Him who was my substitute on the cross, and is my Model in the glory.<a name=287:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having said thus much on the main principle of the section before us -- a principle of unspeakable importance to Christians, in a practical point of view -- I feel it needless to enter into anything like a detailed exposition of statutes which speak for themselves in most obvious

		terms.<a name=288:1></a> I would merely remark that those statutes range themselves under two distinct heads, namely, first, those which set forth the shameful enormities which the human heart is capable of devising; and, secondly, those which exhibit the exquisite tenderness and considerate care of the God of Israel.<a name=288:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the first, it is manifest that the Spirit of God could never enact laws for the purpose of preventing evils that have no existence.<a name=288:3></a> He does not construct a dam where there is no flood to be resisted.<a name=288:4></a> He does not deal with abstract ideas, but with positive realities.<a name=288:5></a> Man is, in very deed, capable of perpetrating each and every one of the shameful crimes referred to in this most faithful section of the book of Leviticus.<a name=288:6></a> If he were not, Why should he be told not to do so.<a name=288:7></a> Such a code would be wholly unsuitable for angels, inasmuch as they are incapable of committing the sins referred to; but it suits man, because he has gotten the seeds of those sins in his nature.<a name=288:8></a> This is deeply humbling.<a name=288:9></a> It is a fresh declaration of the truth that man is a total wreck.<a name=288:10></a> From the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, there is not so much as a single speck of moral soundness, as looked at in the light of the divine presence.<a name=288:11></a> The being for whom Jehovah thought it needful to write Leviticus 18 - 20 must be a vile sinner; but that being is man -- the writer and reader of these lines.<a name=288:12></a> How plain it is, therefore, that "they that are in the flesh cannot please God.<a name=288:13></a>" (Romans 8) Thank God, the believer is "not in the flesh, but in the Spirit.<a name=288:14></a>" He has been taken completely out of his old creation standing, and introduced into the new creation, in which the moral evils aimed at in this our section can have no

	<div class="paragraph">
		And, now, one word as to the second class of statutes contained in our section -- namely, those which so touchingly bring out divine tenderness and care.<a name=289:7></a> Take the following: "and when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.<a name=289:8></a> And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard; <i>thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger</i>: I am the Lord your God.<a name=289:9></a>" (Leviticus 19: 9, 10) This ordinance will meet us again in Leviticus 23, but there we shall see it in its dispensational bearing.<a name=289:10></a> Here, we contemplate it morally, as unfolding the precious grace of Israel's God.<a name=289:11></a> He would think of "the poor and stranger;" and He would have His people think of them likewise.<a name=289:12></a> When the golden sheaves were being reaped, and the mellow clusters gathered, "the poor and stranger" were to be

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Book of Ruth furnishes a fine example of one who fully acted out this most benevolent statute.<a name=290:3></a> "And Boaz said unto her, (Ruth,) At meal-time come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar.<a name=290:4></a> And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed and left.<a name=290:5></a> And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not: and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.<a name=290:6></a>" (Ruth 2: 14-16) Most touching and beautiful grace!<a name=290:7></a> Truly, it is good for our poor selfish hearts to be brought in contact with such principles and such practices.<a name=290:8></a> Nothing can surpass the exquisite refinement of the words, "<i>let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her</i>.<a name=290:9></a>" It was, evidently, the desire of this noble Israelite that "the stranger" might have abundance, and have it, too, rather as the fruit of her own gleaning than of his benevolence.<a name=290:10></a> This was the very essence of refinement.<a name=290:11></a> It was putting her in immediate connection with, and dependence upon, the God of Israel,

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now turn to another statute of our section.<a name=291:10></a> "Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob Him: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.<a name=291:11></a>" (Leviticus 19: 13) What tender care is here!<a name=291:12></a> The High and Mighty One that inhabiteth eternity can take knowledge of the thoughts and feelings that spring up in the heart of a poor labourer.<a name=291:13></a> He knows and takes into account the expectations of such an one in reference to the fruit of his day's toil.<a name=291:14></a> The wages will, naturally, be looked for.<a name=291:15></a> The labourer's heart counts upon them; the family meal depends upon them.<a name=291:16></a> Oh!<a name=291:17></a> let them not be held back.<a name=291:18></a> Send not the labourer home with a heavy heart, to make the heart of his wife and family heavy likewise.<a name=291:19></a> By all means, give him that for which He has wrought, to which he has a right, and on which his heart is set.<a name=291:20></a> He is a husband, he is a father; and he has borne the burden and heat of the day that his wife and children may not go hungry to bed.<a name=291:21></a> Disappoint him not.<a name=291:22></a> Give him his due.<a name=291:23></a> Thus does our God take notice of the very throbbings of the labourer's

This is a most seasonable admonition for the people of God, in every age. A talebearer is sure to do incalculable mischief. It has been well remarked that a talebearer injures three persons -- he injures himself, he injures his hearer, and he injures the subject of his tale. this he does directly; and as to the indirect consequences, who can recount them? Let us carefully guard against this horrible evil. May we never suffer a tale to, pass our lips; and let us never stand to hearken to a talebearer. May we always know how to drive away a backbiting tongue with an angry countenance, as the north wind driveth away rain. <p>In verse 17, we learn what ought to take the place of tale bearing. "thou shalt in anywise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him." In place of carrying to another a tale about my neighbour, I am called upon to go directly to himself and rebuke him, if there is anything wrong. This is the divine method.

		This distinction is easily understood in the case of the sons of Aaron, and, hence, it will serve to illustrate, in a very simple manner, the truth as to the members of the true priestly house over which our Great High Priest presides, and to which all true believers belong.<a name=298:2></a> (Hebrews 3: 6) Every child of God is a priest.<a name=298:3></a> He is enrolled as a member of Christ's priestly house.<a name=298:4></a> He may be very ignorant; but his position, as a priest, is not founded upon knowledge, but upon life.<a name=298:5></a> His experience may be very shallow; but his place as a priest does not depend upon experience, but upon life.<a name=298:6></a> His capacity may be very limited; but his relationship as a priest does not rest upon an enlarged capacity, but upon life.<a name=298:7></a> He was born into the position and relationship of a priest.<a name=298:8></a> He did not work himself thereinto.<a name=298:9></a> It was not by any efforts of his own that he became a priest.<a name=298:10></a> He became a priest by birth.<a name=298:11></a> The spiritual priesthood, together with all the spiritual functions attaching thereunto, is the necessary appendage to spiritual birth.<a name=298:12></a> The capacity to enjoy the privileges and to discharge the functions of a position must not be confounded with the position itself.<a name=298:13></a> They must ever be kept distinct.<a name=298:14></a> relationship is one thing; capacity is quite another.<a name=298:15></a>

		It may, however, be objected that the fact of Christ's being a spotless lamb is not sufficient to roll the burden of guilt from a sin-stained conscience -- a sweet-savour offering would not, of itself, avail for a guilty sinner.<a name=317:1></a> This objection might be urged; but our type fully meets and entirely removes it.<a name=317:2></a> It is quite true that a burnt offering would not have been sufficient where "leaven "was in question; and hence we read, "Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a <i>sin offering</i>, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.<a name=317:3></a>" (verse 19) The "sin offering" was the answer to the "leaven" in the loaves -- "peace" was established, so that communion could be enjoyed, and all went up in immediate connection with the "sweet savour" of the "burnt offering" unto the Lord.<a name=317:4></a>

		Thus much as to Pentecost -- after which a long; period is entered to roll on ere we have any movement amongst the people.<a name=318:2></a> there is, however, the notice of "the poor and stranger" in that beautiful ordinance which has already been referred to in its moral aspect.<a name=318:3></a> Here we may look at it in a dispensational point of view.<a name=318:4></a> "And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest; thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the Lord your God.<a name=318:5></a>" (verse 22) Provision is here made for the stranger to glean in Israel's fields.<a name=318:6></a> The Gentile is to be brought in to participate in the overflowing goodness of God.<a name=318:7></a> When Israel's storehouse and winepress have been fully furnished, there will be precious sheaves and rich clusters for the Gentile to gather.<a name=318:8></a>
