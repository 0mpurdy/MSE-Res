for the Holy Spirit has come down on earth, and this it is which gives to the church its unity and corporate responsibility upon earth.<a name=302:10></a> It is with the church as with a human body, all the component parts of which are said to be entirely renewed in a very short period of time, yet the individual remains the same man: the spirit of man which is in him attaches vitally to itself, and appropriates successively new heterogeneous elements, and the unity and the person change not.<a name=302:11></a> There are three great truths which are connected with Christ, the centre of all truth, or, if you please, three different positions in which He is seen: dead and risen; then in heaven (with this corresponds, as its proof, the presence of the Holy Spirit upon earth, <a href="../bible/John.htm#16">John  16</a>); and lastly, His return down here.<a name=302:12></a> Dead and risen -- thus is the church, His body, justified, risen with Him.<a name=302:13></a> Such is the doctrine of justification; and although it is evidently true as to the whole church, considered as a body, yet in its application day by day, and for each conscience, it is an individual matter for each.<a name=302:14></a> The Holy Spirit dwells as the seal of this doctrine in the body of an individual as in a temple.<a name=302:15></a> Then in heaven Jesus is hid in God, yet crowned with honour and glory; the doctrine which thence flows is the presence of the Holy Spirit in the church upon earth,<sup>+++</sup> in His body; of the Holy Spirit who gives to this body its unity, and makes the terms "body of Christ" -- "<mark>bride</mark> of Christ" -- "church of Christ" to be applicable to those who, upon earth, are united to Him who is in heaven, and who thus form a unity upon earth; the dead in Christ being for the moment out of sight.<a name=302:16></a> If this is understood (for one may be converted and not understand it), one desires, as <mark>bride</mark> of Christ, the return of the <mark>bride</mark>groom.<a name=302:17></a> Justification is connected with His death and resurrection; for we know that His work has been accepted on high.<a name=302:18></a> The unity of the church, and her waiting for Christ as is becoming for a faithful <mark>bride</mark> -- this it is which is connected with the glory of Christ on high, and the presence of the Holy Spirit down here.<a name=302:19></a> These are the two great truths which have been specially put forward, which, as I believe, God Himself has put forward at the present moment, and which have produced so much disquietude in those who desire to remain without the sphere of their influence -- whether in the national churches or in dissent.<a name=302:20></a> That there should be ignorance of these things, one can well understand; that there should be opposition to them is indeed sad; but to say that these truths are secondary is utterly to deceive oneself.<a name=302:21></a> To make little account of the glory of Christ manifested in the unity of the church here below is, in truth, a proof that that glory and the love of Christ for His church are not dear to the heart, and therefore offers little opportunity of speaking to the conscience.<a name=302:22></a> If after having urged upon a son his duty towards a tender and affectionate father, and having explained to him the nature of filial affection, he should ask one to trace out accurately his duty, one might well refuse; he has not the mind to understand his position: the request is the request of a hireling.<a name=302:23></a> The feeling must be awakened if conscience is to act; but woe, woe to him in whom it does not exist!<a name=302:24></a> It is just the same with regard to the responsibility of the church, the grace of the relationship must be owned, and it is the heart taught by the Holy Spirit which understands it.<a name=302:25></a> I doubt not that there is enough to condemn, by means of the conscience itself, him who thus fails; but to do so is neither my task nor my desire.<a name=302:26></a> If the heart could be awakened so as to feel the force of this relationship, of this obligation -- that would be the most precious fruit of all the conflict in which I have had to engage on these points.<a name=302:27></a> Israel might have been condemned by the law; but is not the appeal of God much stronger, and Israel much more hardened, not to have replied to it, when it is said, and said in vain, "Go yet, love a woman beloved of (her) friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the Lord toward the children of Israel"?<a name=302:28></a> For, as the first principle is love, if that fails, all fails.<a name=302:29></a> I admit, and I always have admitted, that one may understand the love which saves without knowing that the church is the <mark>bride</mark> of Christ; but under existing circumstances, this it is which the Holy Spirit in a peculiar way calls to mind: "The Spirit and the <mark>bride</mark> say, Come.<a name=302:30></a> And let him that heareth say, Come.<a name=302:31></a>" Such is the normal position, such the primary testimony which the church renders.<a name=302:32></a> After that, it can turn towards others and say, "And let him that is athirst come," for living waters already flow there; "and whosoever will," etc.<a name=302:33></a> But for Christians this is the Spirit's last behest to the church pointing out her true position.<a name=302:34></a> Her sentiments are based upon her relationships to Christ, and the Spirit demands that those who hear should be in unison with this desire of His heart.<a name=302:35></a> Is it wrong to engage those who have heard the voice of the good Shepherd, to take the position of the <mark>bride</mark> and to join in the cry, "Come"?<a name=302:36></a> But the doctrines of the presence of the Holy Spirit here below in the Church, and of the return of Christ, are identified with its unity upon earth, with the position of <mark>bride</mark>, or rather of her who here below is espoused to be presented as a chaste virgin unto Christ, and with the desire of His coming, which detaches us from all that is not of Him, and attaches us entirely, exclusively, to Himself.<a name=302:37></a> It is easy to understand how those who are in national establishments feel themselves troubled by such a truth.<a name=302:38></a> They have quite another sort of unity; and, as to them, division is that which separates from what is really union with the world and subjection to another than Christ.<a name=302:39></a> That dissenters -- who, faithful in separating from that which is contrary to the precepts of the gospel have made churches, though they have never apprehended, but contrariwise have rejected, the idea of the church upon earth -- should be opposed to it, this also is intelligible enough.<a name=302:40></a> But it ought not to enfeeble the power of these two great truths upon our hearts, nor alienate us from them.<a name=302:41></a> Division in the latter case is sometimes in appearance less reasonable, because the evil among them is less gross than elsewhere, but they have not accepted, and still do refuse to accept these truths.<a name=302:42></a> They have no influence upon their manner of acting.<a name=302:43></a> That there should be patience there can be no doubt; but that these two immense truths should not produce effects, that they should leave those who oppose them in tranquillity -- will never be the case.<a name=302:44></a> It is well for brethren, and even for those who oppose, to understand what really is in question.<a name=302:45></a> Hitherto the unity and the responsibility of the church have been denied.<a name=302:46></a> The return of Christ has had no practical effect upon the opponents of these doctrines.<a name=302:47></a> Scarcely are they even now recognised as being strongly probable -- which is not such a conviction as can furnish a motive for conduct; while all the affections of the church ought to be formed upon, and her walk regulated by, these doctrines, while awaiting Christ's return.<a name=302:48></a> I find two things presented in the word as the great means of judging of the state of the people of God: 1st, the comparing it with the state in which God placed them at the first; 2nd, with the glory of Christ who is about to return.<a name=302:49></a> Compare <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#5">Isaiah  5</a>for the first and chapter 6 for the second.<a name=302:50></a>

		<a href="..\..\target\jnd\JND3.htm#381"> JND volume 3 page 381</a> 		This truth enables us to apprehend what the true position of the Church is.<a name=381:4></a> Christ was upon earth, but at the same time one with His Father.<a name=381:5></a> He was manifesting Him upon the earth.<a name=381:6></a> He was a man upon earth, but He was a heavenly man, displaying upon earth the spirit and sentiments of heaven, where love and holiness reign; because God is love and holiness.<a name=381:7></a> He says, "The Son of man which is in heaven.<a name=381:8></a>" He was separate from sinners and yet at the same time perfect in grace towards them.<a name=381:9></a> In His case, His Person was the cause of it (He being at the same time true man and acting by the power of the Holy Ghost in a dependence upon God, which constituted His perfection as man).<a name=381:10></a> In the case of the Church it is clear that the question is no longer of a divine person, yet she is not of the world, even as Christ was not of the world.<a name=381:11></a> United to her Head in heaven by the Holy Ghost come down from thence, dead and risen with Him and seated in Him in heavenly places, her character is purely heavenly.<a name=381:12></a> She is upon the earth, where the Holy Ghost has come down, to manifest there a heavenly walk -- the motives and the mind of heaven.<a name=381:13></a> She lives above in Christ by the Spirit; her life is hid there with Christ in God; she seeks for nothing down here, declaring plainly that she is yet seeking her country.<a name=381:14></a> She is one, she knows it: it cannot be otherwise.<a name=381:15></a> Can her heart recognize that Christ has another <mark>bride</mark> as companion of His heavenly joys?<a name=381:16></a> The manner of her being necessitates her unity, as well as the character of her <mark>bride</mark>groom, and the unity of the Spirit.<a name=381:17></a> She is upon earth; she sighs after her country, but still more after the <mark>bride</mark>groom who will come to receive her unto Himself, that, where He is, there she may be with Him.<a name=381:18></a> In the meantime she bears testimony upon earth, as united into one body by the presence of the Holy Ghost.<a name=381:19></a> This is the place where God owns her, till Christ comes to take her to Himself.<a name=381:20></a> From that time she will bear testimony in the glory and by the glory to the love which has placed her there, and to the mighty redemption which has taken poor sinners and placed them in the same glory as the Son of God, and in the same relations with His Father, except that which is essentially divine -- "that in the ages to come he [God] might shew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.<a name=381:21></a>"

		<a href="..\..\target\jnd\JND8.htm#289"> JND volume 8 page 289</a> 		But the main point is the reducing the <mark>bride</mark>, the Lamb's wife, when made ready and the marriage come, to a mere city receiving a succession of inhabitants, and not the complete and perfect <mark>bride</mark> of Christ -- His body, presented to Himself a glorious church, without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing -- as Eve to Adam by God.<a name=289:1></a> And how is a woman a corporate symbol?<a name=289:2></a> It is a symbol of the church, which is a body of people, but represents its unity and completeness, not its capacity of being indefinitely extended.<a name=289:3></a> The symbol of a body of people is not a corporate symbol in this sense, but just exactly the contrary.<a name=289:4></a>

	<p>
		<a href="..\..\target\jnd\JND31.htm#190"> JND volume 31 page 190</a> 		One abstract remark may be made.<a name=190:4></a> Our affections and our duties flow from the relationship in which we are set.<a name=190:5></a> It is clear that if we are creatures of God, our duties as such flow from our knowledge of that.<a name=190:6></a> So with our earthly duties and affections -- they flow from our relationship one with another, whether as husband and wife, or father and child.<a name=190:7></a> It is a very simple remark, but of all importance, with regard to the saints' position.<a name=190:8></a> But then I must be in this relationship to have these affections, and I must know what the relationship is to which those duties belong.<a name=190:9></a> If I had no consciousness of being a child, and happened to meet my father, I should have no sense of the duties and affections belonging to me as a child.<a name=190:10></a> In order to have right affections, I must be <i>in</i> the relationship to which the affections belong, and I must <i>know</i> that I am in it too.<a name=190:11></a> The relationship must be known as mine, in order to possess the affections belonging to it.<a name=190:12></a> I cannot love Christ as a Saviour, if I do not know whether He is a Saviour or not to me; I cannot love God as a Father, if I am not sure whether or not I am a child.<a name=190:13></a> Now the importance of this is, that a full settled knowledge of salvation is the spring and foundation of our duties to God -- not only the knowledge of the fact of salvation, but of what that salvation has brought me into.<a name=190:14></a> It has made me a child, and I am bound to walk and feel as a child.<a name=190:15></a> It is so if I take Christ as He presents Himself at the end of this book: immediately the Spirit and the <mark>bride</mark> say, Come.<a name=190:16></a> If I do not know that I belong to the <mark>bride</mark> of Christ, how can I, when He thus presents Himself to me, say to Him, Come?<a name=190:17></a> It is the relationship in which I am from which all must flow, and no duties and affections are rightly founded until we know ourselves to be in this relationship to God.<a name=190:18></a> There may be a craving after the thing, and there will be.<a name=190:19></a> If I am an orphan, I would give anything to have a father; but I cannot have the affections of a child, because I have not got a father to love me.<a name=190:20></a> Wherever the divine nature is, there is the spring of these thoughts and feelings of love to God, and of holiness; but I cannot have them in perfection for my soul, because I have not the constant enjoyment of my relationship.<a name=190:21></a> A law may be imposed upon a person, but it never produces any affection.<a name=190:22></a> There may be a law which claims certain feelings and affections from me, but that gives no consciousness of the relationship by which these affections are produced: consequently it gives me no power.<a name=190:23></a> This is the real character of the law.<a name=190:24></a> Instead of being founded on a relationship that is existing, it promises that by keeping it I shall get life.<a name=190:25></a> If I keep the law without having real life, I am to get life by keeping it.<a name=190:26></a>

		<a href="..\..\target\jnd\JND31.htm#191"> JND volume 31 page 191</a> 		I find that principle laid down in Scripture -- duty called for in order to the obtaining of life; but never does it produce the thing.<a name=191:1></a> Law claims from man what he ought to be, but it does not and cannot place man in any relationship with God, in which he may enjoy the blessing that belongs to God.<a name=191:2></a> Now it is not so with Christ.<a name=191:3></a> He <i>does</i> bring us, by the salvation which He has wrought, into relationship with God; He gives us a known settled place before God; and then our affections and duties flow from the place we are in.<a name=191:4></a> They are not the means of obtaining the place, but that which belongs to the place we are in.<a name=191:5></a> If we are the <mark>bride</mark> of Christ, we ought to have the feelings and wishes of one that is so.<a name=191:6></a> Throughout, when you enter into these verses, that suggests itself to the heart.<a name=191:7></a> In whatever way Christ is spoken of, there is at once what calls forth a response from the hearts of the saints.<a name=191:8></a> Whatever may be said as to His titles or offices, or what He is, the effect of speaking of Him with whom we are in relationship, is to awaken feelings in our own hearts of what He is to us.<a name=191:9></a> For instance, if I were to speak to a child of its father, as one who had eminently distinguished himself as a hero, or a statesman, the child's feeling at once would be, That is my father.<a name=191:10></a> He would not say, That is a great conqueror.<a name=191:11></a> The child's feeling would be, That great man is my father.<a name=191:12></a> So it would be with a wife.<a name=191:13></a> If she were told that such a person had greatly distinguished himself in any place, and she knew it was her husband, she would say, That is my husband; because all this glory awoke, in the mind of the child or the wife, the consciousness of the relationship in which they stood to the one to whom they belonged.<a name=191:14></a> Now that is the case with the church of God.<a name=191:15></a> You cannot speak of any glory of Christ or of God, that does not awaken in the heart of the saint the consciousness of what God and Christ are to itself.<a name=191:16></a> This is characteristic of the existence of such a relationship, and the affections that belong to it.<a name=191:17></a> You cannot speak of the person with whom others are in relationship, without awakening in their hearts the sense of what the person is to them.<a name=191:18></a>

		<a href="..\..\target\jnd\JND32.htm#267"> JND volume 32 page 267</a> 		I see this distinction going on all through.<a name=267:9></a> In Isaiah 60 we have the King and the <mark>bride</mark>.<a name=267:10></a> God could not identify Himself with His people Israel when they failed in their responsibility to Him, and He cast them off; but when, in Isaiah 60, we see them in the stability of glory, their iniquity having been forgiven and carried away into the land of forgetfulness, "the sons of the strangers are to build their walls, and the nation and kingdom that will not serve them are to perish," etc.<a name=267:11></a> They will exercise dominion, but not in grace; power is mentioned in the seat of righteousness at Jerusalem.<a name=267:12></a> This made the apostle cry out, "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!<a name=267:13></a> how unsearchable are his ways, and his judgments past finding out!<a name=267:14></a>"

		<a href="..\..\target\jnd\JND52.htm#60"> JND volume 52 page 60</a> 		Dear Miss Maria Barton, -- I suppose I must have perceived that this objection could be raised, for in the fourth edition,<sup>+</sup> which I got to look at it, I have, 'All this (1 Thessalonians 4: 14-16) is a matter which belongs exclusively to the saints -- to those who, sleeping or waking, are Christ's, and who will be, from that moment, for ever with the Lord.<a name=60:1></a>' The truth is, the mind is justly occupied with what concerns the church; and so I find in the New Testament many passages refer directly to the christian saints who form the church, because they were there and then before the writer's or Holy Spirit's mind, which yet from other places we may know to be true of Old Testament saints.<a name=60:2></a> Here the word 'exclusively' meant to the exclusion of the wicked dead.<a name=60:3></a> I do not doubt the Old Testament saints will arise, though in many a passage they are not at all brought before the mind; because the Spirit was founding and encouraging the hopes of Christians then tried, perhaps persecuted, not meaning to deny that Old Testament saints would be in the kingdom.<a name=60:4></a> The word 'exclusively' does not apply here to the Old Testament saints, but to the world; but the mass of passages in the New Testament apply in fact only to the church.<a name=60:5></a> Other passages say we shall sit with Abraham and Isaac in the kingdom, and the Lord teaches clearly their resurrection.<a name=60:6></a> That which the Old Testament saints do not form is the body and the <mark>bride</mark>.<a name=60:7></a>

		<a href="..\..\target\jnd\JND52.htm#244"> JND volume 52 page 244</a> 		Dearest Alex Ord, -- It is to know where the marks are not, not where they are, which is difficult.<a name=244:1></a> Compare Acts 2 and 4 and see; though I admit that did not last long.<a name=244:2></a> The great yet simple secret is the presence of the Holy Ghost in the body being lost as to power (for He is there), disowned.<a name=244:3></a> The ruin then shews itself in various ways, leaning on human wisdom; leaning on clerical importance to give decency and credit to the world; so that it can join the church without suffering or the cross; leaning on particulars, "I am of Paul," etc.<a name=244:4></a>, for schisms in the early church were not separations.<a name=244:5></a> I suspect the first separation to have been a godly, though an ill-formed thing, that of Novatus; corruption drove him to it, but he had enough of corrupt principles, or habits rather, in his mind, to go wrong in the formal ground of separation; the incapacity to discern the working of the enemy; the having ceased to expect the Lord; not merely divisions but the scattering of the sheep, so that they are not in any division at all, but in the world (Satan's place) alone.<a name=244:6></a> Scattering I think much stronger than division: "he catcheth the sheep and scattereth them.<a name=244:7></a>" Nay worse, the building up of immense worldly systems with perhaps some sheep in them, hidden, and starved often too, and calling these immense systems the church; setting up Satan in it as in popery, or selling what they pretend to be the <mark>bride</mark> of Christ, and where many of Christ's sheep are, to kings and princes for money; yea seeking them, as Jeremiah reproaches Judah, instead of their seeking it.<a name=244:8></a> Is not this ruin?<a name=244:9></a> Say a few of us have escaped and fled out.<a name=244:10></a> Why so?<a name=244:11></a> Because it was all ruin.<a name=244:12></a> The denial of the Spirit would be found in the denial of gifts, or in gifts denying the body, no matter which, for the Holy Ghost is in both.<a name=244:13></a> But ruin is found in this that the church, such as God formed and fashioned it, <i>does not exist at all</i> save as He sanctions two or three meeting in the name of Jesus.<a name=244:14></a> When this is done, if it be in the spirit of the unity of the whole body (woe to them if it is not) the Lord will be there.<a name=244:15></a> I am not uneasy about a hundred meetings; they broke bread from house to house.<a name=244:16></a> If it were separating in heart from brethren, or a fleshly spirit of self-will or self-importance, or excluded any saints really walking as such, then of course it would be evil; and a spiritual person would find it out the first day; but, if in unity and love, twenty meetings in a town are all one to me.<a name=244:17></a> I like small gatherings provided they are really in the unity of the Spirit.<a name=244:18></a> The brethren may come to need them yet.<a name=244:19></a> Great power, I believe, would bring them; little power needs them.<a name=244:20></a> It is clear self-importance or chagrin may set them up without God; but that which has brought in the ruin I believe to be moral.<a name=244:21></a> "All seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's"; "All men forsook me.<a name=244:22></a>" "All they which are in Asia are turned away from me" -- not from Christ absolutely, but they would not go the whole path of faith with the apostle; they feared the cross, the rough and unseemly road the Spirit of God led them.<a name=244:23></a> The world had come in in the shape of ease and respectability; it is the first form which the devil puts on, for it is order and comeliness for the flesh; but it is the world and Satan, hence power is wanting for the purpose of resisting the other forms, heresy (in opinion) and clericalism; and the vessel of power becomes obnoxious because his standard troubles the conscience, instead of his spiritual power acting on the heart as well (for when the former is reached in a Christian, and not the latter, he kicks against it) and the church goes its own way into the hands of Satan in a worldly clerical road.<a name=244:24></a> Wise was God indeed to choose not many mighty, not many noble, not many rich; they find it hard to submit their comforts and comeliness to God's.<a name=244:25></a> A rich body of Christians will become practically poor and simple, or practically worldly.<a name=244:26></a> Such is my thought said in haste.<a name=244:27></a>
